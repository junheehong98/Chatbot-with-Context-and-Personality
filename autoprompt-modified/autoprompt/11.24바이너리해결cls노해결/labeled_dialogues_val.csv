"Could I just stop you there? Sorry to interrupt, but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want.",0,0,0,0,1

It looks like you guys work hard.,1,1,1,1,1

What do you think of our price?,1,1,1,0,1
"Your price has gone up sharply, hasn't it?",0,0,0,0,0
"Yes. We regret we cannot maintain our original price. Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised, we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly.",0,1,0,0,1
"I agree with you there, but your price is unreasonable.",0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so. You must compare our price with that of other export houses. I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level.,0,0,1,0,1
"I don't think we'll be able to pay the price. To have this business concluded, you need to lower your price at least by 3 %.",0,0,0,0,0
I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price.,0,1,0,0,1
"Don't you agree with me that in the long run, moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit?",1,1,1,0,1
We've already cut down our price to cost level.,0,1,0,0,1

I'Ve never had a bank account before. Why don't I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does?,0,1,0,0,0
"You know you would spend it. And also, money in the bank earns interest.",1,1,1,0,1
But what if I need my money suddenly?,0,1,0,0,0
"The bank will give you a PIN, and you can withdraw money from any ATM.",1,1,1,0,1
Great! So it's almost the same as keeping it under the matters!,1,1,1,1,1
Not quite. You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars. And sometimes the bank has service charges. But you don't have to worry about that yet. Let's go make your first depot,1,1,1,1,1
OK. Guess I have to do that before. I can make money my first withdrawal.,1,1,1,0,1

"Wow, thank you for telling me these. Do you mind telling me something else, like attendance record, holiday, and how to ask for leave?",1,1,1,1,1
"All new members are likely to ask the same questions. Haha. I can understand that. Every month you have three days off, besides the weekends and some important holidays.

That's really surprising. I always thought they are well matched. What about the kids? Who get custody?,0,1,1,0,0
"Masha, it seems quiet and makable, no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out.",1,1,1,0,1
"That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about. Well, I still can't believe it, Masha and Hero, the perfect couple. When would they divorce be final?",0,0,0,0,0

No. My friend did.,0,1,0,0,1
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here?,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I'm not sure. But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It' s uncomfortable to sit on it. So I usually put it next to me on the table.",1,1,1,0,1
Maybe you lost it before you came here. Or maybe you left it at home.,0,1,1,0,0
I don't think it's at home. I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do?,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then, if it isn't, you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards. Next, you need to replace whatever you lost, your driver's license, things like that.",0,1,1,0,1

John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill. Do we have anyone on stand-by?,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm afraid not, we're very short-staffed at the moment. Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement.",0,1,1,0,1
"Jack, let's go!",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, you are out of breath! What happened?",1,1,1,1,1
Some people are wildly shooting on the next street. We must leave here as soon as possible!,0,0,0,0,0
Take it easy. They will get caught.,1,1,1,0,1

"My pleasure, bye!",1,1,1,1,1

What's your flight number?,1,1,1,0,1
Flight CA216 to Chengdu.,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, it's true. It has been delayed.",0,1,0,0,0
Could you please tell me why?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, of course. The delay is due to heavy rain.",1,1,1,0,1
How long will the delay be? Do you have any further information about it?,0,1,1,0,0
"I am sorry, we don't know the extent of the delay at present. But according to the latest weather forecast, there will be a change in weather soon.",1,1,1,0,1
"We have to wait. Well, is it possible for the rain to stop before noon?",0,1,0,0,0

"Yes, I will. Thanks a lot. Bye!",1,1,1,1,1
Bye,0,1,0,0,0
What are we going to do? I can't get the car out of this ditch. I'm stuck!,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm worried, Tom. I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour.",0,1,0,0,0
I know. This is terrible. What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling!,0,1,0,0,0
I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here?,0,0,0,0,0
I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, now we're stuck. What can we do?",0,1,0,0,0
I don't know.,0,1,0,0,0
"I've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy.",1,1,1,0,1
What do you mean?,0,1,1,0,0
"We're stranded here, Tom. We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car. The car's energy is what will keep us warm.",0,1,0,0,0
I have plenty of gas.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do, it will die soon. Then we'll freeze.",0,1,0,0,0
So what can we do?,1,1,1,0,1
"Turn the lights off.Then, run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible.",1,1,1,0,1
Alright. That's a good idea.,1,1,1,0,1
I wish we hadn't come up here. Now we'll probably be here for days.,0,1,0,0,0
Days?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms. People get stranded for days.",0,1,0,0,0

Sorry.,0,1,0,0,0
It's all right. Where are you going?,1,1,1,0,1
I wanted to see the White House.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, well you don't want this bus, anyway. It goes to Georgetown.",0,1,1,0,1
"Oh, no.",0,1,0,0,0
"It's all right, though. Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A.",1,1,1,0,1

What kind of drink would you like with that?,1,1,1,1,1

"Would you like a super size meal? Only 2 RIB more, you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium. And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes.",1,1,1,1,1
"That sounds good, thanks, I'd like that. Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke, thanks.",1,1,1,1,1
"That's not a problem, Miss. Will that be it?",1,1,1,0,1

I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible.,1,1,1,0,1
That's nice.,1,1,1,0,1
We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings.,1,1,1,0,1
Of course not. We have cooperated for a long time.,1,1,1,0,1
I would like to purchase some meat.,1,1,0,0,1

"Okay, I think that will be all for me today.",1,1,1,0,1
I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, Mr. Bergeron. You mentioned that in your letter. To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.",1,1,1,0,1
"Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.",1,1,1,1,1
Do you sell direct to shops?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.",1,1,1,0,1
Do you keep a stock of these things?,1,1,1,0,1
"In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.",1,1,1,0,1
"That is, your commission.",0,1,0,0,1
"Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.",1,1,1,0,1
Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.,1,1,0,0,1
"The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.",0,0,0,0,0
"According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?",1,1,1,0,1
"We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.",1,1,0,0,1
"We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market...",1,1,1,0,1
Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. Besides our price is worked out according to the costing. A 10 % commission means an increase in our price. We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.",0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, that's just too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.",1,1,1,0,1
"Ah, Mrs. Miller, but in this case am I covered?",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, yes. We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction.",1,1,1,0,1
"All right, but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair. And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency.",1,1,1,0,1
Very good. We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair.,1,1,1,0,1

"Well, I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month. It hasn't arrived yet.",0,1,0,0,0
"Certainly, Ms. Ransom. Do you have an order number?",1,1,1,0,1
Have you worked out the offers. Mr. Thou?,1,1,1,0,1

How long does your offer remain valid? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan.,1,1,0,0,0

Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.,1,1,1,1,1
One last thing. Is it waterproof?,1,1,1,0,1
We have been over this a hundred times! We are not getting a pet!,0,0,0,0,0
Why not? Come on! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty!,1,1,1,1,1
Who is going to look after a dog or a cat?,1,1,1,0,1
"I will! I'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard!",1,1,1,1,1
"What if we want to take a vacation? Who will we leave it with? Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.",0,1,0,0,0
Ok. How about we get a cat or a ferret?,1,1,1,1,1
"We're planning on having children soon, I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.",0,1,0,0,1
Fine! Let's get a bird then! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk! A parrot would be awesome!,1,1,1,1,1
"I'll tell you what, I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.",1,1,1,1,1
Yay!,1,1,1,1,1
"Good evening, Mr. Lee and thank you for choosing our airline. We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked. Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat?",1,1,1,0,1
Overbooked? Give up my seat? I don't understand.,0,0,0,0,0
From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft. That's overbooked.,0,1,0,0,1
"I know what overbooked is, I just don't understand how that could happen?",0,1,1,0,0
"Actually it's a common practice to overbook, as passengers often don't take their flight as scheduled. Most of the time there is no problem but today, more passengers arrived than we have seats,",0,1,1,0,1
So who has to stay behind?,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first we ask for volunteers. If someone like yourself volunteers, they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year. If no one volunteers we just have to select someone.",1,1,1,0,1
Ok. I'll volunteer. I could use a free ticket!,1,1,1,1,1

I'll need you to pay more than that.,0,0,0,0,0
How much more?,0,1,0,0,0
How does $ 900 every month sound to you?,1,1,1,0,1

"Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio.",0,0,1,0,0
In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.,1,1,1,0,1
Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that's a lot of weight!,1,1,1,1,1
It's not that much. Just watch... I'm ok...,1,1,1,0,1

How does the political system work in your country?,1,1,1,0,1
We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament. Most people call them mp's.,1,1,1,0,1
"Each mp belongs to a political party, right?",1,1,1,0,1
Almost all of them do. A few are independent. That means that they do not belong to a party. If one party more than half of the mp's. they form a government. That means that they choose a prime Finist,1,1,1,0,1
What's a cabinet?,1,1,1,0,1

How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for?,1,1,1,0,1

I'm sorry. We don't have this color in your size. We have some green ones in your size. Would you please have a look at this green one?,1,1,1,0,1

It's 486 yuan.,1,1,0,0,1
"Mrs. Wang, would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable?",1,1,1,0,1
"As I said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.",0,0,1,0,0
"Just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.",1,1,1,0,1
So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.,0,1,1,0,0
"The ball is in your court, Mrs.Wang. What price would you suggest?",1,1,1,0,1
"To make your offer workable, I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken.",0,1,1,0,1
"That won't do. You see, our profit margin is very narrow. It simply can't stand such a big cut.",0,0,0,0,0
"I hate to disappoint you, Mr. Brown, but if that's the case, we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere. Do think it over, please. We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion.",0,1,1,0,1

But you bought it only last month.,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, but ever since I bought it, it gains about five minutes a day, so I' Ve got to have it repaired.",0,1,0,0,0
How long will it take us to get there?,1,1,1,0,1
I think about ten minutes by bus.,1,1,1,0,1
"It's not far away, then. Let's walk, it's beginning to rain.",1,1,1,1,1
Wait! I think I see a bus coming now. Let's hope it's the No. 22 bus.,1,1,1,1,1

"I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?",1,1,0,0,1

Ok.,0,1,0,0,0

"Certainly sir, this is our train schedule. We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm.",1,1,1,0,1
How long does it take to get there?,1,1,1,0,1
"About twelve hours. We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train. If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, I think that is the best option. Do you serve food on the train? Twelve hours is such a long time!",1,1,1,1,1

Great! I'll take it.,1,1,1,1,1
Here you are sir. Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot. Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train!,1,1,0,0,1
I understand. Thank you very much!,1,1,1,0,1
Have a great trip.,1,1,1,1,1
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.,1,1,1,1,1
A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?,1,1,1,1,1
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.,1,1,1,0,1
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?,1,1,1,1,1
It sounds like it will be.,1,1,1,0,1

"Some companies use to ban dating among employees, but now they have realized it is something in avertable. People spend so much time at work. It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other.",1,1,1,0,1
"If we think positively, office love can be beneficial to company.",1,1,1,0,1
"Beneficial? I don't think so. If two employees get married, they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon, or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies. If they break up, the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable. By any means, the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating.",0,1,0,0,0
"But if two employees are in love, they will be happy. Happy people are more productive. If they develop an intimate relation with each other, they are willing to share knowledge and experience. It can help to improve work efficiency.",1,1,1,1,1
I doubt that.,0,1,0,0,0
Do you eat a lot of healthy food?,1,1,1,0,1

"You have the point. I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume. Some good things you should try are cranberry juice, wild rice and yoghurt.",1,1,1,0,1
What's special about these things?,1,1,1,0,1
"Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic. Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice. Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein, vitamins and is also acidic. People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day, your guts will be much more settled.",1,1,1,0,1
Thanks. I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now.,1,1,1,1,1
"I've been so tired recently. I've been trying, but I don't think I'm up to this job.",0,1,0,0,0

Have you decided?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. I want to get a better job.,1,1,1,0,1
Could you tell me why you want to quit?,0,1,1,0,0
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues.,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, that's terrible. Do you want to get a higher salary in our company?",0,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid not. I've promised my girlfriend. We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay.,0,1,1,0,1
"OK, I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you. However, I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay.",1,1,0,0,1
Thank you so much for your advice.,1,1,1,0,1
And every best wish for your new job.,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1

"It wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.",0,1,0,0,0
"We could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.",1,1,1,0,1
"Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, too.",0,1,0,0,0
"If we don't hurry up, we'll miss the show. Should we take the bus?",1,1,1,1,1
"We're already late, so I think we had better take a taxi.",0,1,0,0,1
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. Let's just take the bus.,0,1,1,0,1
Fine. Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives.,1,1,1,0,1
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes. don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even buy your ticket for you.,1,1,1,1,1

"See, now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!",1,1,1,1,1
Let's go over this plan again.,1,1,1,0,1
"From Vancouver, we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg.",1,1,1,1,1
"And that is mostly flat, right?",1,1,1,0,1
"Relatively, once we're out of Alberta, anyway. Then it's hills again in Aitoba.",1,1,1,0,1
"And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto, right?",1,1,1,1,1
That's right. And up in to Quebec. And that's where we stop.,1,1,0,0,1

Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime?,1,1,1,1,1
"Good morning, sir. What can I do for you?",1,1,1,1,1
I'm Bill. I'm in Room 908. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. She said it was too much for her.,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize. Room 908 is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet.",1,1,1,0,1
"Anyhow, I'd like to change our room.",0,1,1,0,1
"No problem, sir. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from.",1,1,1,0,1
All right. I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep.,1,1,1,0,1

"Oh, sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first.",1,1,1,0,1
I can help you with that.,1,1,1,1,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1

Perfect! Please add on an order of onion rings.,1,1,1,1,1
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine.,0,1,0,0,0
What's wrong with the fax machine? Is it urgent?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, very urgent. And there is no other fax machine around. And the office of our boss is closed, so I can not use his machine either. And his secretary is out. Do you have any suggestion?",0,0,0,0,0

"Practice makes perfect. By the way, what do you learn from your job?",1,1,1,1,1

"Yeah, you are a good learner. I must commend you for your good performance.",1,1,1,1,1
Thank you. That's a long way to go for my job.,0,1,0,0,0

It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map.,1,1,1,0,1
Hello. Front desk.,1,1,0,0,1

"Hi, Bob. What can I do for you?",1,1,1,1,1
Is it possible to change to another room?,1,1,1,0,1
Could you please tell me why?,1,1,1,0,1
My room is facing the swimming pool. It's noisy for me. I have a problem sleeping. And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator.,0,1,0,0,0
So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor.,1,1,1,0,1
You're right.,1,1,1,0,1
Okay. Let me check for a room on the first floor.,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
I'Ve only two rooms on the first floor. How about room 108?,1,1,0,0,1

Domestic shipping will be your responsibility, you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles.",1,1,1,0,1
"Fine, we will handle domestic shipping, but what about customs? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control.",0,1,0,0,0
"No, the Chinese company has that all worked out. With the paperwork you receive with the shipment, you should be good to go.",1,1,1,0,1
"Now you're my boss, Mr. Henry.",1,1,1,0,1
Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, nothing in particular.",0,1,0,0,0
"You may ask questions about us, if you have any.",1,1,1,1,1
All right. When can I start?,1,1,1,1,1
What are you doing here today?,1,1,1,1,1
I would like to fight my ticket.,0,1,0,0,1
Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?,0,1,0,0,0

"Hey Joe, what are you doing in this department store?",1,1,1,1,1
"Hi, Rita, I'm just looking for a pair of shoes. I won't be here for long.",1,1,0,0,1
"Why not? When I go shoe shopping, I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices.",1,1,1,1,1
That's my problem. I don't have a lot of options.,0,1,0,0,0
"What do you mean? This is a big store, isn't it?",0,0,0,1,0
"Yes, but I have unusually big feet. That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide, and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into.",0,1,0,0,0
"So how do you usually go about buying shoes, then?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, first of all, I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, you're in the right store. If they don't have it, no one will.",1,1,1,1,1
"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me. I prefer white, so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. Since I'm usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.",1,1,0,0,1
what shall we do after the volleyball match?,1,1,1,1,1
how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look? I remember there is one in the gym.,1,1,1,1,1

"me, too. What did you have in mind?",1,1,1,1,1
"I haven't decided yet, but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must.",1,1,1,0,0
"I agree. They're very lovely, especially "" Huan Huan "".",1,1,1,1,1
"is that the red one? That is my favorite, too. Do you know how much they are?",1,1,1,1,1
"the five dolls are sold together as a set, and they're priced according to the size. The bigger they are the more expensive.",1,1,1,0,1
"oh, I see. If I buy more than a set, can I get any discount?",1,1,1,0,1
I don't think so. All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now.,0,1,0,0,0
any other ideas?,1,1,1,0,1
"there are lots of things, such as postcards, key chains, posters and various arts and crafts.",1,1,1,1,1
it all sounds great. We can go there after the match. I can't wait to see what they have.,1,1,1,1,1
Mom! I hate eating vegetables!,0,0,0,0,0
You don't have to eat them. I don't mind.,1,1,1,0,1
Thanks mom! Can I have dessert now? I love chocolate cake!,1,1,1,1,1
No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables.,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't like them! It's not fair!,0,0,0,0,0
"You can have some fruit for dessert. If you eat an apple and a banana, I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake.",1,1,1,1,1
"Ok... actually, I don't mind eating peas and carrots, buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower.",0,1,1,0,1
"I'll remember that for next time. You'll get extra peas and carrots, buy no broccoli or cauliflower. OK?",1,1,1,0,1
Thanks mom!,1,1,1,0,1
It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place. It gave me a good idea of your product range.,1,1,1,1,1
"It's a pleasure to show our factory to our customers. What's your general impression, may I ask?",1,1,1,1,1
"Very impressive, indeed, especially the speed of your NW Model.",1,1,1,1,1
That's our latest development. A product with high performance. We put it on the market just two months ago.,1,1,1,1,1
"The machine gives you an edge over your competitors, I guess.",1,1,1,0,1
Certainly. No one can match us as far as speed is concerned.,1,1,1,1,1
Could you give me some brochures for that machine? And the price if possible.,1,1,1,0,1
Right. Here is our sales catalog and literature.,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you. I think we may be able to work together in the future.,1,1,1,1,1
Is the factory fully-automated?,1,1,1,0,1
Not completely. Our production process is partially-automated. We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually.,1,1,1,0,1
What about supply of parts to the production line?,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system. And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line.",1,1,1,0,1
What about the smaller components?,1,1,1,0,1
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee.,1,1,1,1,1

I can speak the language better than read and write.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries?,1,1,1,0,1
I think so. I used to be an interpreter.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work?,0,1,0,0,0
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work. I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm.,1,1,1,0,1
What can I get for you? Here is the menu.,1,1,1,1,1

I don't have onions on my list. I'll add them. We should get some tea. Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get?,1,1,1,1,1
Let's get both. We need some coffee too. Is that on your list?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, it is. Here's my list. Is there anything that I'Ve forgotten?",1,1,1,0,1
I think you'Ve got everything. I want to got some chocolate and some cheese.,1,1,1,1,1

"We don't have enough cash, so I'll take my credit card and we can pay with that. Where are the car keys?",1,1,1,0,1

Of course you can. I am sure this one works very well. I just sent dozens of pages. How many pages are you sending? Are you familiar with my fax machine?,1,1,1,1,1

Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete?,0,1,1,0,0
"I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners. They have always followed the contract strictly. We can do business directly with the corporation. As I mentioned before, the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law. Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma. Does it influence your business in China?",0,1,1,0,0
Actually not at present. But we are afraid it will. You know policies influence business to some extent. I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists. China is really a large market. We don't want to lose it.,0,0,0,0,0

"Right, let me run through your options. You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to, but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan.",1,1,1,0,1
"OK, what does that entail?",1,1,1,0,1
"It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember, your certificate is due in 2 months. If you can hold on to it, it'll be much better for your finances.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, it does seem a little silly to cash it now. I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB. Will that be a problem?",1,1,1,0,1
"Not at all, Mr Zu. As the certificate is due in 2 months, you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate.",1,1,1,0,1
"I'm glad you thought of this. I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest, right?",1,1,1,1,1
"Exactly right. If you'd like to go ahead, I can process that for you now, Mr Zu.",1,1,1,0,1

"I'm broke, and I have to catch another bus.",0,1,0,0,0

That was smart.,1,1,1,0,1
"Anyway, do you have any change I can use for the bus?",1,1,1,0,1
I don't have any.,0,1,0,0,0

The bathroom looks lovely. Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you?,1,1,1,1,1
I did it myself. I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement. Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed. I'm sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too. I learnt a lot by doing it myself.,1,1,1,1,1
"So, let's see. You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls. You'Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries. The bath, shower, and washbasin are the same as before, aren't they?",1,1,1,0,1

How long did it take you to do the tiling.,1,1,1,0,1
"As I hadn't done it before, I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet. Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening. Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles. Putting the cupboard up took about an hour, so it took me two days altogether.",1,1,1,0,1

I'm afraid I can't agree with you there. I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we'Ve received from other sources.,0,0,0,0,0
But you must take the quality into consideration. Everyone in the trade knows that US's bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries.,1,1,1,0,1
"I agree that yours are of better quality. But there's competition from synthetic products, too. You can't very well ignore that. Prices for synthetic bristles haven't changed much over the years.",1,1,1,0,1
"There's practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses. That's why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones. To be frank with you, if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us, we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, we'll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price. But I'll have to try, I suppose.",0,1,0,0,0

"I felt after five years in one place, I was ready for something new. I would like to have a job that is challenging, something that I can see and do new things every day.

I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.,1,1,1,0,1
"I have told him how to do it several times, but he's never listened to me.",0,0,0,0,0
Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.",0,1,0,0,0
"Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, make sure you don't lose your temper.",1,1,1,1,1

"the trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet.",1,1,1,0,1
sounds reasonable.,1,1,1,0,1
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.,1,1,1,0,1
and fruits!,1,1,1,1,1
surely it is. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness.,1,1,1,0,1
I've heard that. Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit?,1,1,1,1,1

why not?,0,1,1,0,0
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing!,0,0,0,0,0
it's a pun. They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking.,1,1,1,0,1
"I know, but I think it's not really appropriate for young children.",0,1,0,0,1
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking.,0,0,0,0,0
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty.,1,1,1,0,1
"perhaps you're right,, though. Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow.",1,1,1,0,1
"I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults, but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them.",0,1,0,0,1
that's a good point. I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad.,1,1,1,0,1
"you have to give them credit, though. It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking.",1,1,1,0,1

"That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy?",1,1,1,1,1
A dressy party would be fun!,1,1,1,1,1
That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best?,1,1,1,1,1
We should probably have both.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?",1,1,1,1,1
Maybe we could do both!,1,1,1,1,1

So how does it work? How were you able to make money with the marathon?,1,1,1,1,1
"Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee. Also, they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran. All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars.",1,1,1,0,1
Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society.,1,1,1,0,1

"OK. In my position, I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan. That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan.",1,1,1,0,1
"Not a problem, Sir. If you'd just fill out these forms, and of course with necessary clearance, we can get you the money right away.",1,1,1,0,1
"Mr. Wang, I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai. You can make some changes if it does not suit you.",1,1,1,0,1
All right. Please read it to me.,1,1,0,0,1
"On Friday morning, Mr. Wang, the director of Shanghai Research Institute, will visit you at the hotel. In the afternoon, you will discuss some problems with Mr. Yang, vice manager of computer corporation.",1,1,1,0,1
Very good.,1,1,1,0,1
"On Saturday, you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing. Miss Lu will be your guide.",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, that's great.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hi, I would like to return this TV.",1,1,1,0,1
"Sure, do you have the receipt?",1,1,1,0,1
Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to return this keyboard.,1,1,1,0,1
Ok. may I ask what is the reason for returning these products?,1,1,1,0,1
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.,0,1,0,0,0
"I see, and what about the keyboard?",1,1,1,0,1
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.,0,1,0,0,0
"I am sorry mam, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.",0,1,0,0,1
Fine! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.,0,0,0,0,0
There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out!,0,1,0,0,0
Luckily we got the last two.,1,1,1,0,1
"Look, Danny. The Four Great Inventions!",1,1,1,1,1
"Gunpowder, compass, the paper making, and the printing.",1,1,1,0,1
I really admire those who made such great inventions!,1,1,1,1,1
"May, I don't see why they are great. They are just simple things.",0,1,0,0,0
They look simple today. But they were milestones in their times.,1,1,1,0,1
"Milestones? May, you must be kidding.",0,0,0,0,0
"Just think Bill Gates, those inventions are as important as the windows system.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them.",0,1,1,0,0
"No, quite the contrary.",0,1,1,0,1
Why? Didn't you say that they were milestones?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, but they went to the public without any patent protection.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates.",0,1,0,0,0
What can I do for you?,1,1,1,1,1
I need some medicine.,0,1,0,0,0

Thank you very much.,1,1,1,0,1
It's my pleasure.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you believe in god?,1,1,1,0,1
Not at all. I'm an agnostic. do you?,0,1,1,0,1
I'm not sure. Why don't you believe there is a god?,0,1,1,0,0
I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.,1,1,1,0,1
"I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, there are many things that science hasn't explained yet.",1,1,1,0,1
I'm sure that science will explain everything eventually. I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.,1,1,1,0,1
For example?,1,1,1,0,1
"Religions preach tolerance, but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.",0,0,1,0,0
Yes. Such people don't appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs.,0,0,0,0,0
Didn't you say your friend was American? Where is she going on her honeymoon?,1,1,1,1,1
They're going skiing in Colorado.,1,1,1,1,1
What a coincidence! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon!,1,1,1,1,1
"You're probably right. Oh, what the heck! I'll take it all... in maroon, like you said.",1,1,1,1,1
What a terrible house!,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm sick of it, too.",0,0,0,0,0
"The door bell doesn't work, there's no hot water, and the building is falling apart.",0,1,0,0,0
"It's no use complaining. If we had got enough money, we couldn't put up with it, and would have moved out.",0,1,0,0,0
Sure.,1,1,1,0,1
Hello!,1,1,1,1,1
Is that Sue?,1,1,1,0,1

That'll be fine.,1,1,1,0,1

"Hi, I am Liu Ming. I am calling to tell you that I have got the job.",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, that is wonderful. Congratulations!",1,1,1,1,1
I really feel grateful to you for your reference. They have mentioned this in the job interview.,1,1,1,0,1
Don't mention it. I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality.,1,1,1,1,1
Thanks again. I will start on next Monday. I am sure I will have good performance.,1,1,1,0,1
I agree.,1,1,1,0,1

"It's a big bedroom with a drawing room, facing a beautiful wood.",1,1,1,0,1
Is there a bathroom?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, but there is one downstairs, which my daughter used some years ago.",1,1,0,0,1
It sounds good. Could I go and see it myself?,1,1,1,1,1
"Certainly, you're welcome anytime.",1,1,1,1,1

Hi. I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, we do. You'll go through the acceptance application, then a first review, then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval. Why don't you read through this brochure? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan, the terms and conditions, etc.",1,1,1,0,1

I surely will. How much is this wood carving?,1,1,1,1,1
You are an expert on it. That wood carving is very rare. But I'm so sorry. that is not for sell.,0,1,0,0,1
That's OK. Is anything else recommended?,1,1,1,0,1
Do you have any special request?,1,1,1,0,1
I'd like to see some traditional arts.,1,1,0,0,1
So that means you are shopping for presents?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends.",1,1,1,1,1
"Actually, I think the paper-cuts is OK, because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it. They think that is a miracle.",1,1,1,1,1
Sounds good. I'll take paper-cut.,1,1,1,0,1
"I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country, you can pick the one you like best.",1,1,1,1,1
You collect them yourself? I think that you are just doing the wholesale.,0,0,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts. I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country.",1,1,1,1,1
"Wow, you are the expert on it.",1,1,1,1,1
Operator. Can I help you?,1,1,1,0,1
"I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing, China. The number is 2135367 8, and I want to speak to Mr. Zhang.",1,1,1,0,1
To Mr. Zhang in at 2135-3678?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, that's right.",1,1,1,0,1
May I have your name and telephone number?,1,1,1,0,1
"My name is Luo Gang, and the phone number is 513-3284.",1,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Luo, will you hold the line, please - - - Mr. Luo, there is no Zhang at that number. Will you check the number again, please?",0,1,0,0,1
"What the number I gave you, operator?",0,0,0,0,0

Are there any special requirements on the project? And shall we talk around it in details?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it. Besides, you see, in recent years, we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness.",1,1,1,1,1
That's a good idea. We can improve our technology to meet your special need.,1,1,1,1,1
And please let white color dominate.,1,1,1,0,1
OK! I've noted it down. And any others?,1,1,1,1,1
Oh! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city.,1,1,1,0,0
I'll tell them.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor.",1,1,0,0,1
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise. And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery.,1,1,1,0,1

"That's no problem. Let me see... You still have ten days annual leave left, is that right?",1,1,1,0,1
Yes. I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off.,1,1,1,0,0
That's long leave. How's your project coming along?,1,1,1,1,1
The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week. I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on.,1,1,1,0,1

Only a few.,0,1,0,0,0
What's a few?,1,1,1,0,1
"I've gotten six, I think.",1,1,1,0,1
Did you pay your fines?,0,1,0,0,0
Of course I have.,1,1,1,0,1
How much are the parking tickets?,1,1,0,0,1
I think they're $ 130.,1,1,1,0,1
That's expensive.,0,1,0,0,0
I just got a parking ticket.,0,1,0,0,0
You should probably pay the fine soon.,0,1,0,0,0
I'm going to pay it today.,1,1,0,0,1
"Are you doing anything right now, Diana?",1,1,1,1,1
"I am typing a report for the moment, Mr. Robbins. Anything I need to do?",1,1,1,0,1
Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter?,1,1,1,0,1
Is it urgent?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5. It's about a contract.",0,1,0,0,1
"Ok, I am coming.",1,1,1,0,1
"Please take a seat, Diana. Have you got your spare pens and pencils?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I have this time. But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating, can I ask you halfway?",1,1,1,0,1
"No, I'd prefer not. I don't want any interruptions every other minute, but you can ask me at the end of the letter.",0,0,0,0,0
All right. I understand now. Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments.,1,1,1,0,1
"Of course, Diana. You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it.",0,1,0,0,1
"Certainly I will, Mr. Robbins. By the way, may I use a window envelope?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, that's fine. Now when you finish these, I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order, using the last names, and then make a list.",1,1,1,0,1
You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names?,1,1,1,0,1
"Right. And the last thing, we are going to clean the files out tomorrow. Now let's begin.",1,1,0,0,1
You're finally here! What took so long?,0,0,0,1,0
I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.,0,1,0,0,0
It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.,1,1,1,0,1
"I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.",0,1,0,0,0
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.,1,1,1,0,1
I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.,1,1,1,0,1
"It would be better for the environment, too.",1,1,1,0,1
I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.,0,1,1,0,0
Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.,1,1,1,0,1
The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.",1,1,1,1,1
That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!,1,1,1,1,1
"So, are you going to quit driving to work then?",0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.",0,1,0,0,0
"That's really convenient. We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent, though.",1,1,1,0,0
I can take two thousand off. That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand.,1,1,0,0,1
That's great. Every little bit counts. And we don't need the parking space. I guess we could rent it out.,1,1,1,1,1
"Sure, for at least three thousand per month.",1,1,0,0,1
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five. That's the price we were shooting for.,1,1,1,0,1
"I'm glad. Now, there's a deposit fee of two month's rent.",1,1,0,0,1
Hello. I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren' t they ready?,0,1,0,0,0
They'll be ready by this afternoon.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, no! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning.",0,1,0,0,0
Is that right? We're very sorry.,1,1,1,0,1
"I thought it was "" the same day "" service.Anyway, please do hurry.",0,0,0,0,0
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, then, would you send it to Japan, please?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, we'll do so.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hello, welcome to Lincoln Bank. What can we do for you today?",1,1,1,1,1
I want to effect payment under an L / C today.,1,1,0,0,1
"No problem. OK... just checking for you. Ah, I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction. What you can do is buy some US dollars, using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount.",1,1,1,0,1
That seems alright. What's the exchange rate like today? Good or bad?,1,1,1,0,1
"It's not too bad today, actually. 828.23.",1,1,1,0,1
"How can I help you, sir?",1,1,1,1,1

Do you have an appointment?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I did it yesterday. Our meeting should be 2 pm.",1,1,1,0,1
I guess she forgot your meeting. She is attending an important meeting in the company. Will you have a seat? May I leave a memo for her?,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
She will be back soon.,1,1,1,0,1
Excuse me. Would you please make a suit with this material?,1,1,1,0,1
Sure. May I take your measurements?,1,1,1,0,1
"Please don't make it too tight. This is for autumn wear, so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath.",1,1,1,0,1
"I see, sir. Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th, that's in a week's time?",1,1,1,0,1
"The 10th? I'm sorry, but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th. Could you have the suit ready by the 8th, or at the latest, the 9th?",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, a business suit usually takes ten days' time. But in your case, we'll try to have it ready sooner. How about coming for your fitting on the 8th? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th?",1,1,1,0,1
"That's fine, thank you.",1,1,1,0,1
Good morning everyone. Thank you for attending the meeting today. I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda. So let's get started with the first issue.,1,1,1,1,1
We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior.,1,1,1,1,1
"I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ), we have Mr. Brown, who is Vice President of Sales.

"I am glad to see everyone is here and on time. Let's get started! Susan, toss out some of your ideas.",1,1,1,1,1
It seems that many boys are fighting there.,0,0,0,0,0
Break it up! I will not permit fighting in this campus.,0,0,0,0,1
the air quality in this city is horrendous! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again!,0,0,0,0,0
exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment.,0,1,1,0,0
"on top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city.",0,1,1,0,0
"as much as I love this city, I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.",0,1,1,0,0
"I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse",0,1,1,0,0
what is the greenhouse effect exactly?,1,1,1,0,1
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature.,0,1,1,0,1
"I see, so it's similar to global warming?",1,1,1,0,1
"they're related to one another, yes.",1,1,1,0,1
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.,1,1,1,0,1
"people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, but it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well.",0,1,1,0,0
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations.,1,1,1,0,1
"I think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place.",1,1,1,1,1
Would you like some cookies? I just made them.,1,1,1,1,1
"Thank you. Yes, I would.",1,1,1,0,1
"These are chocolate, and those are almond-flavored.",1,1,1,0,1
I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm... this is delicious.Are they hard to make?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, they're really quite easy. Wait a minute, I've got the recipe right here.See... these are the ingredients, and then you just follow the directions.",1,1,1,1,1
That does look easy. I think I'll make some tonight.,1,1,1,1,1
Can I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow.,1,1,0,0,1
"Hold on, plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110.",1,1,0,0,1
"Well, I want to stay under $ 100.",0,1,0,0,0
I am sorry Sir. We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same.,0,1,0,0,1
"How do you use an ATM card, Billy?",1,1,1,0,1
It's easy grandpa. Insert you card into the machine here. Then wait a moment. Ok. Now you enter your PIN. It should have four numbers.,1,1,1,1,1
Oh yes. I'Ve got it written down here. Just a minute.,1,1,1,0,1
You really shouldn't write it down. You should memorise it. You can change it to a more convenient number if you like.,0,1,1,0,1
"Ok, I'Ve entered my PIN. There are several options on the screen. I guess I just choose which service I want, don't I?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes. Choose the service you need to use. If you choose to withdraw money, the machine will ask you how much you want.",1,1,1,0,1
"I can just enter the amount using the key, right?",1,1,1,0,1
That's right. Give the machine a moment to process you request. Then take your money.,0,1,0,0,1
"These machines aren't very difficult to use. In fact, I quite like them. They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hello, is Jennifer in?",1,1,1,0,1

"Oh, no, Nathan, I... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know.Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more.",1,1,1,0,1
But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating. I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished.,0,1,1,0,0
But don't you like this place? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely.,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, only you liked it really, darling.",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, why didn't you say so then? But I still think we've made a good buy.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hi, Bob, everything okay?",1,1,1,1,1

Oh? What's that?,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, you know I have some students studying for their master's degree. One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy.",0,1,0,0,0
What gift?,0,1,0,0,0
"It's an Egyptian carpet. The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. Seeing what gift was, I was really uncomfortable. I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor. I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift, so I refused it.",0,1,0,0,1
You refused the gift? That's terrible.,0,0,0,0,0
"I know, but I really can't accept such an expensive gift. I explained to him why, but he seemed really upset about it. I think he might have taken it the wrong way.",0,1,1,0,0
Perhaps. He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade.,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I am worried about. I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored. But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor. I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page.,0,1,0,0,0

What kind of place shall we rent?,1,1,1,1,1
"It should be close to the university. Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up.",1,1,1,0,1
Absolutely. That's the most important thing to take into consideration. I'm not too worried about the size of the flat.,1,1,1,0,1
"Neither am I. so a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. Do you mind if it's in a noisy area.",1,1,1,0,1
"I don't mind. I'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home.",1,1,1,0,1
"Good point. Ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us.",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early.",1,1,1,1,1
How much do you think the rent will be?,1,1,1,0,1
I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.,1,1,1,0,1
I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest. It's too soon.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June?",1,1,1,0,1
The earliest we can do is by the end of June.,0,1,0,0,1

What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?,1,1,1,0,1
"Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you think about 20 % this time?",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, 20 % would be perfect.",1,1,1,0,1
Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00. The total will be $ 43.20.,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, that was one fantastic meal!",1,1,1,1,1

"Hmm. Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, we always go to the movies. Can't we do something different?",1,1,1,0,1

Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for?,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, there are some similarities that come up. Because both groups are made up of mothers... so as before, we can play up on maternal instincts, hygiene, safety, along those lines. But that being said, there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here.",1,1,1,0,1
"Right, that makes sense. What's the average age?",1,1,1,0,1

"Gosh sir, thank you, sir! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department.",1,1,1,1,1

"Oh, my God! I've been cheated!",0,0,0,0,0
What? What did you buy?,0,0,0,0,0
It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it!,0,0,0,0,0
What is it? Why did you buy a brick?,0,0,0,0,0
"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick.",1,1,1,0,1
And?,0,0,0,0,0
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.,1,1,1,0,1
And it's a brick?,0,1,0,0,0
Yes.,1,1,0,0,1
I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,0,0,0,0,0
"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new.",0,1,0,0,0
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.",1,1,1,1,1
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?,0,1,0,0,0
He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0,0,0,0,0
"Aha! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So, what I think is, you deserve to get cheated!",0,0,0,0,0
"C'mon, don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.",1,1,1,1,0
That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.,0,0,1,0,0
"You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick?",0,1,0,0,0
"Hello, Arthur. What seems to be the problem?",1,1,1,1,1

"Sounds like you may be far-sighted. OK, then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.",1,1,1,0,1

"I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.",0,1,1,0,1
Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.,1,1,1,0,1
So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner.,1,1,0,0,1
How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?,1,1,1,0,1
I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.,0,1,1,0,0
"I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.",1,1,1,0,1
I think that we should leave 10 %.,1,1,0,0,1
$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.,1,1,0,0,1

"Yes. I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon, because I'll be on a business trip in two days.",1,1,1,0,0
"Well, you have to let your flu run its course. You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest. Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery.",1,1,1,0,1
But I'm going on a business trip in two days!,0,1,0,0,1

Yes.,1,1,0,0,1
"Well, I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here.",1,1,1,0,1
What do you suggest?,1,1,1,0,1
"The way it is now, the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour. But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation.",0,1,1,0,0
You mean because people have to go across town to get here.,0,1,0,0,0
Yes. Some people spend half of the morning on the road.,0,1,0,0,1
"That's true. But our staff meetings are very important, Arnold. I don't know how we can function without them.",1,1,1,0,1
I think they are important too.That' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them.,1,1,1,1,1
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful. I'm aware of that.,0,1,1,0,1
"Here's what I propose. I think we should meet once every two weeks, but meet for ninety minutes or more.",1,1,1,1,1
Well.,0,1,0,0,0
I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that.,1,1,1,1,1
You mean you want to run the meetings?,0,1,0,0,0
"No, not really run them. But I could help organize them. I could discuss meeting topics with you, and then prepare a schedule for each meeting. I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused, and people would prepare better.",1,1,1,1,1
Hmm. But we would meet every two weeks.,1,1,1,0,1
"I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer, and better organized.",1,1,1,0,1
"I am not against the idea, Arnold.It may really be more efficient, as you say. I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month, and see how it works.",1,1,1,0,1
Excellent. I would be happy to get started on it.,1,1,1,1,1

"I'Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. Of course I won't miss the local food either. You know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place.",1,1,1,1,1

that's so disappointing. I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think it's right, but I can understand why they might. Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!",0,1,1,0,1
"regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.",0,1,0,0,1
"I agree. Hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.",1,1,1,0,1
let's hope so.,1,1,1,0,1
I need to use the ATM.,1,1,0,0,1

You are right. How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs?,1,1,1,1,1
Sounds good. May I have a look?,1,1,1,0,1
"Of course. These paintings have many designs, such as animals, flowers, landscape, aquatics and so on.",1,1,1,1,1
"They are beautiful, but I can't understand the connotation in them. Let me see the handkerchiefs.",1,1,1,0,0
All right. Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, I like the bamboo design. What is this?",1,1,1,1,1
"This is a series of animals, called Chinese zodiac.",1,1,1,0,1
Good. So I will take three series and five bamboo ones.,1,1,1,0,1
"OK, I will wrap them for you.",1,1,1,0,1
Can you make out what he's saying?,0,1,0,0,0

Excuse me.,1,1,1,0,1
Yes?,0,1,0,0,0
"Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram, please?",1,1,1,1,1
Certainly. Go along Queen's Road...,1,1,1,0,1
Along Queen's Road...,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, and turn right at the Hilton Hotel.",1,1,1,0,1
Right at the Hilton.,1,1,1,0,1
"Then go up Garden Road, past the Cathedral.",1,1,1,0,1
The Cathedral?,1,1,1,0,1

"The kind that never goes out of fashion, I guess.",1,1,1,0,1
I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm sure you're right. I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year.,0,1,0,0,0
The changes are usually not that dramatic. We just got some pictures of the latest fashion. Would you like to take a look?,1,1,1,1,1
Good. I think I'll choose this single breasted one. When can I get it?,1,1,1,0,1

Don't take it too hard. There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I am all ears. Maybe they are helpful.",1,1,1,1,1

Are there many employers?,1,1,1,0,0
Yes. The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers.,1,1,1,0,1
"So there will be many large companies in the personnel market, right?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, there are many famous corporations.",1,1,1,0,1
When will there be a job fair?,1,1,1,0,1
Every Saturday and Sunday,1,1,1,0,1
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market?,1,1,1,0,0
"No, it's free.",1,1,1,0,1
How about going there to have a look now?,1,1,1,1,1
"OK, let's go.",1,1,1,1,1
Could you show me the T-shirt on the model?,1,1,1,0,1
"Here you are. We have three different colors, white, blue and pink.",1,1,1,1,1

"Yes, yes. It seems that everything is settled.",1,1,1,0,1
Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid?,1,1,1,0,1
"We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts, whether they are currently with this bank or not.",1,1,1,0,1
That's not a problem.,1,1,1,0,1
"Of course, if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank, or open new accounts with you.",1,1,1,0,1
Thank you very much. We always welcome new customers.,1,1,1,1,1
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking.,1,1,1,1,1
We should plan to move out of here before July. I'm tired of living in apartments.,0,1,0,0,0
"I know, dear. I am too. But we've just been too busy to look for a house.",1,1,1,0,1
We need to find a good realtor.,1,1,1,0,1
"Not necessarily. If we use a realtor to find a house, it will be more expensive.",0,1,1,0,1
What do you mean?,0,1,1,0,0
"Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something, we have to pay him.",0,1,0,0,0
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles.,1,1,1,0,0
"Yes, that's often true. But you have to pay them.",0,1,0,0,0
"I still think we should have a realtor.We' re new in this country. We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also, the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has",1,1,1,0,0
"Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems, I have friends. They can help us.",1,1,1,1,1
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor?,0,1,1,0,0
It takes a little more time. We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them.,1,1,0,0,1
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor?,1,1,1,0,1
"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves.",1,1,1,0,1
Why?,0,1,1,0,0
"Because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor.",0,1,0,0,1
Hmm. It all sounds very complicated.,0,1,0,0,0
It is. But buying a house is very important. So it takes time.That' s why we haven't done it yet. It's very troublesome.,0,1,0,0,0
I want to look in the papers today. Maybe we can see something we like.,1,1,1,1,1
Alright. I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store.,1,1,0,0,1

"So that concludes the introduction. Now let's move to the first part of my talk, which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan. So first, right off the bat, When looking at the marketing plan, tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with...",1,1,1,1,1
"We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...",1,1,1,1,1
"That's correct. If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year.
