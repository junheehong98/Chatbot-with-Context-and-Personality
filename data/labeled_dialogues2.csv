That's nice. Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, I know that. But at those places. the prices they ask you are ridiculously high, and if you don't bargain hard, you will get ripped-off.",0,0,0,0,0
"True, learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, but personally I hate bargaining. If I bargain, I might come to a lower price. But I will never know the true price of what I am buying, and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places.",0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, I have the same feeling. Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality. Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed. But at a wholesale market, you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not.",0,1,0,0,0
That's why I like department stores more. Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to.,0,1,0,0,0
"I understand. While it's always good to follow the local customs, I guess there are exceptions.",1,1,1,0,1
Would you mind if I ask the insurance policy of our company?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, I don't. Please.",0,1,0,0,0
I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance.,0,1,1,0,0
"Of course. And 2 - week paid vacation a year, a 5 - day work week.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hello, I'm returning your phone call.",1,1,1,0,1
I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast.,1,1,1,1,1
"No problem, but what were you calling about?",1,1,1,0,1
I needed to talk to you about your son.,0,1,0,0,0
Is he messing up in school?,0,1,0,0,0
He was acting up in class one day last week.,0,0,0,0,0
What was he doing?,0,1,0,0,0
He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class.,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know what's gotten into him.,0,1,0,0,0
"If you could, would you please talk to him?",1,1,1,0,1
"I will get right on that, and I am very sorry.",1,1,1,0,1
I really appreciate your help.,1,1,1,0,1
Are you from America?,1,1,1,0,1
No. I am Canadian. Are you Chinese?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. Nice to meet you!,1,1,1,1,1
"Nice to meet you, too. Let me show you around.",1,1,1,1,1
"Thanks, I will appreciate it. How long have you been here?",1,1,1,1,1
"About two years, but it seems as if I got here yesterday.",0,1,0,0,0
"That's right. Once the contract with Stars.com is final, we'll deal with Zina.",1,1,1,0,1
I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her.,0,0,0,1,0
Don't jump the gun. She's in the driver's seat right now. You have to be patient.,1,1,1,0,1
"Don't worry. I'm patient, but vengeance will be mine.",0,0,0,0,0
"Settle down, Elvin. If you're not careful, you'll give our plan away. Zina's smart, you know.",0,0,0,0,0
Hi. I'm looking for some good deals on produce.,1,1,1,0,1
You might want to try the mangoes.,1,1,1,0,1
Can you describe a mango to me?,1,1,1,0,1
It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit. It has a big seed in it.,1,1,1,0,1
Do I eat the seed?,0,1,0,0,0
"Maybe some animals eat the seed, but humans don't. You'd have to soak it for 10 years.",0,1,1,0,0
What's the price of these mangoes?,1,1,1,0,1
Today you get a 50 - percent discount. They're only $ 1 each.,1,1,1,0,1
Tell me what they taste like.,1,1,1,1,1
Their flesh is soft and juicy. It has a citrus taste. It's sweet.,1,1,1,0,1
"Do I need to buy them ripe, or will they ripen at home?",1,1,1,0,1
"Just press into it gently with your thumb. If it feels soft, it's ready to eat.",1,1,1,0,1
Where do mangoes come from?,1,1,1,0,1
"These are from Guatemala, but we're going to start getting mangoes from India.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hello, can I speak to Alice, please?",1,1,1,1,1
"Hold on, please.",1,1,1,0,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
"Sorry, but she ’ s out.",0,1,0,0,0
Could you tell her Tom Green called?,1,1,0,0,1
I ’ d be glad to.,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, let's have your firm order.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, here is our offer, 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt, FOB New York. You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market.",1,1,1,0,1
Your price is rather high. We cannot accept it. Can you bring the price down a little?,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, if it weren't for our good relations, we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price.",1,1,1,0,1
I can't agree with you. We have quotation from other sources too. Their prices are lower than yours.,0,0,0,0,0
"But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies. In fact, there is no room to negotiate the price now. You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year.",0,0,0,0,1
It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price.,0,1,0,0,0
Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night?,1,1,1,1,1
Of course. Is the dinner still on?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place.",1,1,1,1,1
We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice.,1,1,1,1,1
"That's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark.",0,1,0,0,0
It can't be that bad.,1,1,1,0,1
"I wish it wasn't, but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here.",0,1,0,0,0
"Really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime.",1,1,1,0,1
"Do me a favor, and take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better.",1,1,1,0,1
"Ok, we will. How do you get around in the evenings?",1,1,1,1,1
"When I first moved in, I walked everywhere. But within a week, I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station! Now, I always take public transportation.",0,1,0,0,0
Has anything else happened to you?,1,1,1,1,1
"Nothing else has happened to me, but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close.",0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we'll be careful. Thanks for letting me know.",1,1,1,0,1
"Dad, I've finished my homework.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, what game do you want to play?",1,1,1,1,1
Do you want to play poker?,1,1,1,1,1
Do you know how to play it?,1,1,1,0,1
I'll teach you.,1,1,1,1,1
OK. Teach me how to play the game.,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, Betty. Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period, we decided to employ you formally. And now we need to sign the formal agreement.",1,1,1,0,1
"Thank you very much, Mr. Smith. I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team. May I see the agreement first?",1,1,1,1,1
"Of course. If you have any questions, just bring them out.",1,1,1,1,1
"OK, thank you. Well, I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview. Can you give me some explanations?",0,1,1,0,0
"Well, it ’ s like this, during your first year, you will enjoy this salary level, a year later, we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 %.",1,1,1,0,1
Can we add up this item to the agreement?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement. Do you have any other questions?",0,1,1,0,0
"No, thank you. Shall we sign the agreement now?",1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, welcome to our company. I hope we can cooperate happily.",1,1,1,1,1
Thank you. I'll work hard.,1,1,1,0,1
I ’ d like to open a current account.,1,1,1,0,1
Certainly. May I see your social security and your ID Please.,1,1,0,0,1
Here your are. I wonder how much interest can I earn for my current account.,1,1,1,0,1
Oh. Current account don ’ t pay our interest.,0,1,0,0,0
Why is that?,1,1,1,0,1
"It ’ s primarily design for business transactions. That is write checks to pay the bills, buying things and sending money. We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account.",1,1,0,0,1
I see. How do I draw money from my news then.,1,1,1,0,0
May I bring you a salad?,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, yes.What do you recommend today?",1,1,1,1,1
Rose-petal salad.,1,1,1,0,1
"OK, I'll have it for change.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hello, Shogun Restaurant.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hi, I would like to make a dinner reservation.",1,1,1,1,1
"Of course, what evening will you be joining us on?",1,1,1,1,1
We will need the reservation for Tuesday night.,1,1,0,0,1
What time would you like the reservation for?,1,1,1,1,1
We would prefer 7,1,1,0,0,1
For how many people,1,1,1,0,1
There will be 4 of us.,1,1,1,1,1
"Fine, I can seat you at 7",1,1,1,0,1
Thank you. The last name is Foster.,1,1,0,0,1
See you at 7,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you so much. I appreciate your help.,1,1,1,0,1
Good afternoon. What can I help you with today?,1,1,1,1,1
I have a Time Deposit here and I'd like to get the money now.,0,1,0,0,1
The maturity date isn't for another 10 weeks. Are you aware of that?,0,1,0,0,1
"Yes, I know, but I need the money urgently for a family emergency, you see. I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw, but I'm afraid there just isn't time.",0,1,0,0,0
"The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit, so unfortunately you will lose some interest.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, it can't be helped. I really must have that money. Thank you.",0,1,0,0,0
May I take your order now?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice, please.",1,1,0,0,1
How would you like your eggs?,1,1,1,1,1
"Hard-boiled, please.",0,1,0,0,1
"And your toast, light or dark?",1,1,1,1,1

"Just a moment, please.",1,1,1,0,1
Would you like to order now?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, can you recommend some steak?",1,1,1,1,1
Sure. I think pepper steak is quite good. Many guests like it very much.,1,1,1,1,1
OK I will try it. Do you have a small portion? I am afraid I can't finish the large one.,1,1,1,0,0
Yes madam. I will give you the small one.,1,1,0,0,1
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in?,1,1,1,1,1
We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings.,0,1,1,0,1
I'm the painter. You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains. That will probably be pretty expensive too. Having good curtains made isn't cheap.,1,1,1,0,1
You mean we can't just buy curtains already made?,0,1,0,0,0
"Absolutely not. The windows must be measured, and then the curtains need to be made professionally. So that will take a while. Maybe a month or so.",0,1,0,0,1
"While the curtains are being made, I can start having people look at the kitchen. I can't stand that old kitchen. I won't be able to cook there. I don't want to use that electric stove.",0,0,0,0,0
We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen. I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation. I will look in the Yellow Pages. I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green.,1,1,1,0,1
I agree. The colors must be soft and pleasant. You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners.,1,1,1,1,1
"Me? Cook our dinners? Hah! You will be cooking, dear. You will cook.",0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don't think so. I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then. So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year.",0,1,0,0,0
And you'll have to sell your motorcycle. And your cameras. Right?,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week. How is that?,1,1,1,0,1
Four times might be enough. Not once or twice.,0,1,0,0,1
We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks.,0,1,1,0,1
"All right. Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value, up to the port of destination only.",1,1,0,0,1
I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount.,1,1,1,0,1
"Ok, this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer.",0,1,0,0,1
That's understood.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door.,0,1,0,0,0
"You're so careless, Billy.",0,0,0,0,0
"Sorry, Mum, I'll lock it right away.",1,1,0,0,1
I've done it for you.,1,1,1,0,1
Can I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I want to buy a suit.",1,1,0,0,1
What about the red one? It's the best seller.,1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, it's quite cute. I don't think it will fit me. I would prefer a darker color. Have you a black one?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, We have.",1,1,1,0,1
Excuse me. I would like to book a table at 13:00.,1,1,0,0,1
"Sure, for how many?",1,1,1,0,1
"Three seats, please.",1,1,0,0,1
May I have your name?,1,1,1,0,1
Speed Airlines Reservation. May I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
Yes. Do you have any flight to Paris on 15th? I want one leaving in the afternoon.,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. Flight DP336 leaves at 15:16. Is that all right?,1,1,1,0,1
Is it a direct flight?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, Sir.It has an hour layover in London.",0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I don't think I want it.",0,1,0,0,0
I feel like to wear my hair in this way.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, it's really popular these days.",1,1,1,1,1
Do you think it's suitable for me?,0,1,0,0,0
"Honestly speaking, I think the one next to it suits you better.",0,1,1,0,1
"Even though I really like it, it's just too modern for me.",0,1,0,0,0
That's not true. Look over there! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you.,0,0,0,0,0
Okay then. And I also want to have my hair colored.,1,1,1,1,1
Which color do you like?,1,1,1,1,1
Claret-red.,1,1,1,0,1
Nice choice.,1,1,1,1,1
How long will it take? I hope it won't be too long.,0,1,0,0,0
I hope not but it will take at least three hours.,0,1,0,0,0
Now it's my son's turn to wait.,0,1,0,0,1
Could you drive me to the bank?,1,1,0,0,1
"Of course, ma'am, Tell me where to go.",1,1,1,1,1
Go down this road and then turn left.,1,1,0,0,1
All right.There we go.,1,1,1,0,1
Can you believe that Obama is our new President?,1,1,1,1,1
I ’ m so happy about that.,1,1,1,1,1
Did you vote for him?,0,1,1,0,0
I sure did. How about you?,1,1,1,1,1
I voted for him.,1,1,1,0,1
I have complete confidence in our new President.,1,1,1,0,1
Is that right?,1,1,1,0,1
I know he will help change America.,1,1,1,1,1
"I hope so, because America needs a change.",1,1,1,0,1
"I feel like things are already changing, because he was elected.",1,1,1,0,1
I agree with you completely.,1,1,1,0,1
I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands.,1,1,1,0,1
"You know, you really ought to get a new pair of jeans. Those are falling to pieces.",0,0,0,0,0
"But this is how I like them, Mum. They ’ re just beginning to look right.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, you ’ d better get another pair for work at least or you ’ re sacking on the spot.",0,0,0,0,0
I think it might be a good idea to work as a guide.,1,1,1,0,1
Where do you intend to go?,1,1,1,0,1

That's beautiful.,1,1,1,0,1

That's all right. Maybe we can make another arrangement.,1,1,1,0,1
You're very kind to say so. Thank you. Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him?,1,1,1,0,1
"I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem. In fact, he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon.",0,1,0,0,0
"Tomorrow afternoon, Um... you see, I've made an appointment with Mr. Comet for tomorrow afternoon. In order to meet Mr. Zhang, I have to cancel the appointment with Mr. Comet, I'm afraid.",0,1,1,0,0
"I'm terribly sorry, Mr Miller, but Mr. Zhang is really busy this week.",0,1,0,0,0
I understand. When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon?,1,1,1,0,1

"Well, each room is 40 dollars a week.",1,1,0,0,1
That sounds all right to us.,1,1,1,0,1
When do you want to move in?,1,1,1,0,1
How about tomorrow afternoon?,1,1,1,0,1
"Fine, I'll be expecting you.",1,1,0,0,1
See you tomorrow.,1,1,1,0,1
"Are you still hungry, Ryan? How about some more squid balls?",1,1,1,1,1
Squid balls? How about some more fruit!,1,1,1,1,1
"Wow! You really like fruit, huh? You've already had 3 plates!",1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, it's funny. I usually don't ever eat fruit...",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, whatever suits your fancy. I'll press the service button again.",1,1,1,0,1
"Mon and I got in another fight, Boris.",0,0,0,0,0
"oh, Iris! what was it about this time?",0,1,0,0,0
it was over food. I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no.,0,1,0,0,0
I believe she was right. You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat.,1,1,0,0,1
"oh, she keeps saying that. She never allows me to have them.",0,0,0,0,0
I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth.,1,1,1,0,1
"But, Boris, i am not a baby any more.",0,1,1,0,1
"well, that's true.",1,1,1,0,1
how about your mother?,1,1,1,0,1
she also believes in healthy diet. And she requires us to have regular meals.,1,1,0,0,1
poor you. It seems we are in the same boat.,0,1,1,0,0
"Oh, i am grateful for my mother on this point. her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit.",1,1,1,0,1
really? so you don't have fried food at all.,0,1,0,0,0
not really. I may have some occasionally for a chance. But I don't indulge myself too much.,0,1,0,0,0
how do you manage it?,1,1,1,0,1
"it's pretty simple, Iris. Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat.",1,1,1,0,1
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking.,1,1,1,1,1
We should plan to move out of here before July. I'm tired of living in apartments.,0,1,0,0,0
"I know, dear. I am too. But we've just been too busy to look for a house.",1,1,1,0,1
We need to find a good realtor.,1,1,1,0,1
"Not necessary. If we use a realtor to find a house, it will be more expensive.",0,1,0,0,1
What do you mean?,0,1,1,0,0
"Realtors always get a commission. If the realtor helps us find something, we have to pay him.",0,1,0,0,0
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles.,1,1,1,0,0
"Yes, that's often true. But you have to pay them.",0,1,0,0,1
"I still think we should have a realtor. We're new in this country. We don't know all the laws of buying a house. And also, the realtor will inspect the house. He can tell us if the house has any problems.",1,1,1,0,1
"Of course we need a house inspector. But we can hire an inspector on our own. As for the legal problems, I have friends. They can help us.",1,1,1,1,1
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor?,0,1,1,0,0
It takes a little more time. We have to check the ads in the paper. Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads. Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them.,1,1,1,0,1
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor?,1,1,1,0,1
"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves.",1,1,1,0,1
Why?,0,1,1,0,0
"That is because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher. He will have to pay a commission to the realtor.",0,1,0,0,1
Hmm. It all sounds very complicated.,0,1,0,0,0
It is. But buying a house is very important. So it takes time. That's why we haven't done it yet. It's very troublesome.,0,1,0,0,0
I want to look in the papers today. Maybe we can see something we like.,1,1,1,1,1
All right. I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore.,1,1,0,0,1
"So, got any more ideas for the website?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes, I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room.",1,1,1,1,1
But we registered at Macy's. People can just buy gifts there.,1,1,1,0,1
The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America. The chat room is more convenient.,0,1,1,0,1
You're right. They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things.,1,1,1,1,1
Or discuss what gifts they could buy together.,1,1,1,1,1
Any other ideas?,1,1,1,0,1
We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments.,1,1,1,1,1
And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures...,1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, that will be the best part. Jack hasn't seen yours yet, right?",1,1,1,1,1
No. He has no idea what a fat little pig I was!,0,0,0,0,0
I have a taste for something sweet.,1,1,1,0,1
What are you thinking?,1,1,1,0,1
I want some kind of dessert.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, what kind of dessert do you want?",1,1,1,1,1
I was thinking about ordering some kind of pie.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you know what kind you want?,1,1,1,0,1
I honestly don't know.,0,1,1,0,0
Did you want to know my favorite kind of pie?,1,1,1,1,1
What's your favorite kind?,1,1,1,1,1
My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple.,1,1,1,0,1
That sounds really good to me right now.,1,1,1,1,1
I'm happy to help.,1,1,1,1,1
"Hi, Cole. What can I do for you?",1,1,1,1,1
"if you have a few minutes, I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company.",1,1,1,1,1
"sure, have a seat.",1,1,1,0,1
thanks.,1,1,1,0,1
let me just grab your file. How long have you worked for us now?,1,1,1,1,1
I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now.,1,1,1,0,1
one year already? It's amazing how time flies like that. Are you enjoying your job?,1,1,1,1,1
"yes, but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement.",1,1,1,0,1
I see. What job did you have in mind.,1,1,1,0,1
"well, I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager.",1,1,1,0,1
do you understand what duties that job would entail?,0,1,1,0,0
"yes. I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department. I assume there'd be more meetings, paperwork, and other responsibilities, too.",1,1,1,0,1
that's right. Do you have any experience in management?,1,1,1,0,1
"yes. In fact if you look at my resume, you can see that I was a manager before I started this job.",1,1,1,0,1
"well, I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position. According to company policy, you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though, so fill this application form in",1,1,1,0,1
ok. Thanks for your support.,1,1,1,0,1
"Thanks for coming in today, did you have any trouble finding us? Please take a seat.",1,1,1,1,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
"So, let ’ s get started. tell me a bit about your educational background.",1,1,1,1,1
"Sure! Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose this course of study for two reasons. I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track provided, and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in psychology.",1,1,1,1,1
"Interesting. And, your postgraduate studies?",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master ’ s in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service.",1,1,1,1,1
"Very good. Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience. I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.",1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care, and process management. I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.",1,1,1,1,1
Interesting...,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company. With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five percent, which had a direct impact on revenue.",1,1,1,1,1
We still have an important attraction.,1,1,1,0,1
What is that?,0,1,1,0,0
Melbourne Zoo.,1,1,1,0,1
What's special about Melbourne Zoo?,1,1,1,0,1
"The place is a must-see. This zoo was built in 1862, and it's the oldest zoo in the world, and still among the best. There are more than 3,000 species of animals here, including the popular kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and wombats.",1,1,1,1,1
Are the animals caged?,0,1,1,0,0
"Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages. Rather, they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens.",1,1,1,0,1
That's really special.,1,1,1,0,1
"Of course, I'm sure you will like it.",1,1,1,1,1
Are you interested in mountaineering?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes. in some sense. I should say I like mountain climbing, you know, because I'm not so professional. How about you?",1,1,1,1,0
"I'm the same with you, an amateur mountain climber. 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation. We spent two days in the mountains.",1,1,1,1,1
How did you spend the night there?,1,1,1,0,1
"We pitched a tent in the night, waiting for the sunrise. Wow! It was too beautiful.",1,1,1,1,1
"I had a similar experience, but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country.",1,1,1,0,1
"Tasha Mountain? It's very famous in China, isn't it?",1,1,1,1,1
Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains.,1,1,1,0,1

I'd love to.,1,1,1,1,1
Bob! Your eyes look bloodshot. Did you not sleep well?,0,1,1,0,0
I had a drop too much last night. I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine. And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table.,0,0,0,0,0
"You have it right. Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China. Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship, especially in Northern China.",1,1,1,1,1
"I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me. But if I keep gulping down one cup after another, I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick.",0,1,0,0,0
"You lose face by refusing to drink, and the host might think you refuse to give him face. The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up. This will endear you to your friends.",0,0,0,0,0
"A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night, crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood.",0,0,0,0,0
"Then he must be opening his heart to the friends. In a word, as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort, no one will jeer at you.",0,1,1,0,0
I got you. Next time. I'll preface a toast with a statement like' I can't drink any more' and then drink anyway.,1,1,1,1,1
"May I help you, sir?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I'd like some information about the trains to Beijing.",1,1,1,0,1

"Yes, it will ; this must be the foreign produce.",1,1,1,0,1
This is Chinese made.,0,1,0,0,1
Let me try it on. I think it really suits me. Can you give me some discount on it?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price.",1,1,1,0,1

"Sorry, we can ’ t come down any more.",0,1,0,0,0

Did you call the apartment management yet?,1,1,1,0,1

It was 36 hours ago.,0,1,0,0,0
That's outrageous! I just don't understand why they're not on top of this.,0,0,0,0,0
"Hello, Sir. What can we do for you today?",1,1,1,1,1
Hello. I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C? What is it exactly?,1,1,1,0,0
"L / C stands for' letter of credit'. This is necessary for trade between two countries. A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer, the buyer, and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default. Nowadays, it's sometimes used for domestic trade too.",1,1,1,0,1
So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street!,1,1,1,1,1

Did you take the job?,1,1,1,0,1

Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals? are closely related to this.",1,1,1,1,1
Ok. What else?,1,1,1,0,1
They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you?,1,1,1,0,1
I see. What about the salary?,1,1,1,0,1
"Hm, they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind, or simply tell you what the company is offering. I think the latter is more likely for a starting position, especially if you have little experience. And if they are seriously considering hiring you, they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work. And basically, that's about it.",1,1,1,0,1

You shouldn't laugh at me for it.",0,0,1,0,0
I'm not laughing at you. But let me ask you something?,1,1,1,0,1

Good morning. I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies.,1,1,1,0,1
Of course. Please sit down. How can I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content.,1,1,0,0,1
I see. Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy. We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ”. May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are.,1,1,1,0,1
"I understand. I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home.",1,1,0,0,1
"Let me just check that on my computer. Oakfield is a low risk area, so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month. The other thing to take into account is deductibles.",1,1,0,0,1
In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000. what does that mean exactly?,1,1,1,0,0
"It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you. The insurance policy covers any amount above that, up to the agreed limit.",1,1,0,0,1
"Oh, I see. That ’ s fine. What is the advantage of having higher deductibles?",1,1,1,0,1
"If you have higher deductibles, your premium are lower, because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less.",1,1,1,0,1
It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding. I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree.,1,1,1,0,1
We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders. These are renewable after the first year.,1,1,0,0,1
"If I have a claim, how long does it take to make a settlement? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies, it can take months.",0,1,0,0,0
"That is of great concern to out clients. We aim to satisfy all claims within a month, but we can ’ t guarantee that",0,1,0,0,0

"Hey, John! What do you think are the main causes of war today?",1,1,1,1,1

"Yeah, several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end.",0,1,0,0,0

How do I get there on foot?,1,1,1,0,1

"30,000 NT for ginseng?! Do I have to buy a whole jin?",0,0,0,0,0
You can get a liang if you want. A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin. That would be 330NT.,1,1,1,0,1
Whew! That sounds more like my price range. I'll take two liangs.,1,1,1,1,1
I'll have my brother cut some for you.,1,1,1,0,1

I think account to individual would be best. But which is the quickest way?,1,1,1,0,1

I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day. I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids. I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes.,1,1,1,0,1
Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch. They don ’ t do much else in their free time. At least they always do their homework first.,1,1,0,0,1
"If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch, remember to have something else for them to do. If you don ’ t, they ’ ll get bored and misbehave.",1,1,1,0,1
They could go out and play with their friends.,1,1,1,1,1
Sure. You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time.,1,1,1,1,1
Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing. He watches too much tv too.,1,1,1,0,1

"well, that's true, but living expenses are also higher in big cities.",0,1,1,0,1
"I've considered that. I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent, and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person.",1,1,1,0,1
one person? How about your girlfriend?,1,1,1,0,1
"oh, we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing. She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life.",0,1,0,0,0

"Yes, you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year, and you get it additional week after 4 years, and then again, after 9 years if you decide to stay that long, we promote from within based on performance, so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager.",1,1,1,1,1
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze?,0,1,1,0,0

why?,0,1,1,0,0
"the survey said that the low, income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis.",0,1,0,0,0

and junk food contains lots of fat and oil. There is one final reason why so many people are fat.,0,1,0,0,0

"I'd love to. I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing. It's kind of a children's day. Small kids get dressed up, then walk around with paper bags or baskets, knocking on the neighbor's",1,1,1,1,1
They are supposed to say trick or treat? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy.,1,1,1,0,1
That's kind of cool. But what's the trick mean?,1,1,1,0,1
"Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween, like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree. They usually do it late at night after little kids go",0,0,0,0,0

Does he watch a lot of movies?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, he sure does.In fact, he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university.",1,1,1,1,1
"I would like to make a suggestion then, sir.",1,1,1,0,1
Please do.,1,1,1,0,1
"If your son wants to study film, probably he will start to collect movies himself.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I know that. So I want him to have a good VCR to use.",1,1,1,0,1
May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead?,1,1,1,0,1
DVD? Isn't that like a CD?,1,1,1,0,1
It is very similar. The technology is the same.,1,1,1,0,1
Why is a DVD better than a VCR?,1,1,1,0,1
"For one thing, sir, the quality of the image is usually better.That' s because it's digital.",1,1,1,0,1
But isn't it more expensive?,0,1,0,0,0
"It is a little more expensive, sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate.",1,1,1,0,1
What's that?,0,1,1,0,0
"If your son starts to buy video tapes, he can't keep them very long.",0,1,0,0,0
And why not?,1,1,1,0,1
"Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes, after fifteen years they will all start to rot.",0,1,0,0,0
Hmm. Is that true?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, it is, sir.",1,1,0,0,1
Well. And what about DVDs?,1,1,1,0,1
"This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs, they will last forever. They will never rot.",1,1,1,0,1
Hmm. He might really appreciate that. I know he will start to collect movies at school. Especially if he studies film.,1,1,1,0,1
"So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion, DVD is the wave of the future.",1,1,1,1,1
"Alright, please show me what you have.",1,1,1,0,1

I will explain the problem briefly. We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged.,0,1,0,0,0

"Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau. According to the report, the damage was caused by poor packing. Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases.",0,1,0,0,1

I want to buy some cleansing milk. What would you recommend?,1,1,1,1,1
Your complexion is on the oily side. I suggest you use cleansing gel.,0,0,0,0,0
Anything that can keep my skin clean will do.,1,1,1,0,1
How do you prefer this one? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil. The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy.,1,1,1,0,1
"Hm... the smell is too strong, I can't stand it. I'm very sensitive to fragrance.",0,1,0,0,0
"We've also got a fragrance-free one, specially designed for sensitive skin. I'm sure you'll like it.",1,1,1,1,1

"Mr. Brown, I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem. I'd like, if possible, to see it settled at this meeting.",0,1,1,0,0
"What is it, Mrs. Wang?",1,1,1,0,1
"It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state. They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them.",0,0,0,0,0
Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?,0,0,0,0,0
"Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.",1,1,1,0,1
"Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage.",0,1,0,0,0
"The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing.",0,1,0,0,1
"As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export.",1,1,1,0,1
"I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.",0,1,1,0,1
"The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.",0,0,0,0,1
We've already got in touch with the underwriter. But they have refused to accept any liability. They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage.,0,1,0,0,0
"That's a matter over which we could exercise no control, then. I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement, that is, if you have covered this risk in your coverage.",0,1,0,0,1
"To my regret, we failed to cover contamination. This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us.",0,1,1,0,0
Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, live and learn. It seems we'll have to waive the claim.",1,1,1,0,1
"Lucy, I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder?",0,1,1,1,0
"Monica, wait a moment. I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it.",1,1,0,0,1
I think I can handle it by myself.,1,1,1,0,1
I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.,1,1,0,0,1
"I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.",0,1,0,0,0
Other company rules also need your attention.,0,1,0,0,1
Like this one?,1,1,1,0,1
Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.,0,1,0,0,1

"It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?",0,1,0,0,0
My fish is very dry.,0,1,0,0,0

Would you recommend going there for a few days?,1,1,1,0,1

You ’ re probably right. What do you think about Yangshao?,1,1,1,1,1

"First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl, and whisk them up, quite, so they're quite high and fluffy, and in a hot pan, and you need a pan that's that's kind of small, that the sides go up at an angle. You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite hot, and then you take your whipped up eggs, or whisked up eggs, and pour them into the pan, and as it's cooking, if you take a spatula, and push the bottom layer of the egg, to the side, to the sides, and then to the middle, so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan.",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, OK. Wow!",1,1,1,1,1
"OK. And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over, you'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese.",1,1,1,0,1
Wow. That sounds really good.,1,1,1,1,1
"Mm, it is.",1,1,1,0,1
Wow. What fillings do you recommend?,1,1,1,1,1
"Um, well, if you want to do a real simple one, you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese, and that's easy, or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, anything that you like. If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture. So it's actually cooked in it. It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese.",1,1,1,1,1

"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm, then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that, you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound.",0,1,1,0,1
Good plan. Let me put some iodine on the cut.,1,1,1,0,1

"Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips. Also, some employees receive sales commissions. So good salesmen will naturally earn more.",1,1,1,0,1
"That's understandable. Well, rather than comparing my salary with someone else's, perhaps we could talk about my job performance. Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently?",1,1,1,0,1
"I see your point. However, it might be hard to get a raise approved. Profits were down last quarter, and the whole company is tightening its belt, so anything that affects the annual budget",0,1,0,0,0

Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan?,0,1,0,0,0
"Not exactly. Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad, for example, you, or your direct relative or spouse.",1,1,1,0,1
I see. What about age limitations?,1,1,1,0,1
"There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course, old enough to get a loan, meaning over 18 years of age.",1,1,1,0,1
Got it! I fit into that category very nicely. That's great! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back. Thanks very much.,1,1,1,1,1

"Why? it doesn't make sense. If we do the floors first, and then paint the walls, we will get paint all over our new floor.",0,1,0,0,0

"And then, after the floors are done, we can start to move our furniture in.",1,1,1,1,1
"Sure. If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors, we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so. I can get all the carpet out this weekend.",1,1,1,1,1

I could have Suzy stay at my place.,1,1,1,1,1
"I don't want to do that to you, Karen.",0,1,0,0,0
Why not?,0,1,1,0,0
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold. I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. But I don't know who to ask. I need someone more mature than Jill. It might even be for two or three days.,0,1,0,0,0

It would be hard for just me to do it. I don't know the city at all.,0,1,0,0,0
So what do you see in there?,1,1,1,1,1
This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included. Newly remodeled kitchen. $ 470.,1,1,1,0,1

I had no doubt in my mind that he would win.,1,1,1,0,1
What made you think that?,1,1,1,0,1
Nobody could compete with him.,0,0,0,0,1

"Oh, it was okay. I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative. He thinks that I need to start being more creative.",1,1,1,0,0
Did he actually say that?,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, not in so many words. But I know that productivity is a big issue for him. Oh, he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work, ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department. That, to me, means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing.",0,1,1,0,0
Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said?,0,1,1,0,0
"No, I Don't. Either I shape up or my job is on the line.",0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think you may be overreacting. Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing.",1,1,1,0,1
Do you really think so?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, I do. If you ask around, other people will tell you the same thing.",1,1,1,0,1
"Maybe you're right. Thanks, Don. I feel better.",1,1,1,0,1
I'm glad to hear it.,1,1,1,0,1
What's going on?,1,1,1,0,1
"Nothing really, you?",1,1,1,0,1
I'm throwing a party next Saturday.,1,1,1,1,1
Is that right?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, are you going to come?",1,1,1,1,1
"I'm sorry, I can't.",0,1,0,0,0
Why not?,0,1,1,0,0
I don't really want to.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, why don't you?",0,0,0,0,0
I hate going to parties.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, that's okay.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, sorry.",0,1,0,0,0

Hello again. Have you come to a decision?,1,1,1,1,1
"I'm still not sure about these' Visible' Certificates. What's the real difference, except the amounts available?",0,1,0,0,0
"Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank. Also, they can be cashed in advance, before the maturity is up.",1,1,1,0,1
Right. How about the Bearer Certificates? Can they be cashed before the maturity date?,1,1,1,0,1
"Unfortunately, not. You see, because they are not registered, they can be bought and sold by anyone. They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution.",0,1,1,0,1
"So, if I was strapped for cash, I could transfer it to get some money?",1,1,1,0,0
"Technically, yes.",0,1,0,0,1
"OK, I think I've got it.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hey Mei Hong, how are you getting to Xi ’ an next week?",1,1,1,1,1
I ’ m not sure yet. I may take the train but then again I might take the bus.,0,1,1,0,0
Yeah but the bus takes a long time. You could fly - it ’ s not so expensive these days.,1,1,1,0,1
Really? Maybe I ’ ll do that then.,1,1,1,0,1
"Ok well, you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you.",1,1,1,1,1
Ok. Thanks for that!,1,1,1,0,1
"Can I help you, sir?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, please. I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife.",1,1,1,1,1
What kind of presents do you want?,1,1,1,1,1
"Actually, I don't know exactly. Do you have anything recommended?",1,1,1,0,0
"OK. How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hey, How did you know I came from America?",1,1,1,1,1
"Just a hunch, sir.",1,1,1,0,0
How much again?,0,1,0,0,0
$ 59.95.,0,1,0,0,1
"That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs.",1,1,1,1,1
"Sorry, sir.",0,1,0,0,0
Why not?,0,1,1,0,0
"Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife.",1,1,0,0,1
"Oh, my God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume.",1,1,1,1,0
That's good. And I can also recommend you a good one. It's the brand of DENY.,1,1,1,1,1
DENY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.,0,0,0,0,0
It's $ 60 here.,1,1,0,0,1
That's very unbelievable. Is it fake?,0,1,0,0,0
"Of course not, sir.",0,1,0,0,0
"OK, I'll take one.",1,1,1,0,1

What do you know about our major products and our share of the market?,1,1,1,0,1
"Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States, but particularly have sold very well here in China. So I think in the future you'll find China to be a profitable market as well.",1,1,1,1,1
What made you decide to change your job?,1,1,1,0,1
Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges.,1,1,1,1,1
Do you like this job?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I like it very much.",1,1,1,1,1
What do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson?,1,1,1,0,1

"Yes, I'd like to know something about the salary.",1,1,1,0,1
"I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan. But the specific number will be determined according to your sales.",1,1,1,0,1
When can I get the final decision?,0,0,0,0,0

"Oh, dear, go get another pair. I'll help you change your shorts.",1,1,1,0,1
"Okay, now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job. I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly, is that right?",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, that ’ s right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.",0,1,0,0,0
"So, what changed?",1,1,1,0,1
"Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer.",1,1,1,1,1
"Wow, a real step up!",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent 3 years in that position, but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term.",0,1,1,0,0
"I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?",1,1,1,0,1
I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.,0,1,1,0,0
"Would you tell me how I should send this parcel to Shanghai, China? It contains only books.",1,1,1,0,1
You might send it as'Printed Matter'.,1,1,1,0,1
I wonder if I could have it insured here?,1,1,1,0,0
Of course. How much would you want to insure these books for?,1,1,1,1,1
Let me see... I think I can have them insured for five hundred dollars.,1,1,1,0,1
"Five hundred dollars, so you pay ten dollars for the insurance, that's two percent of the total value of the article.",1,1,0,0,1
Here's a check for ten dollars.,1,1,0,0,1

"OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course.",1,1,1,0,1
Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.",0,1,1,0,1
"I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right?",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.",1,1,1,1,1
Sauvignon Blanc? What's that?,1,1,1,0,0
"That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.",1,1,1,0,1

"It's OK, don't worry, we'll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.",1,1,1,1,1
All right. What varietal is that?,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.",1,1,1,0,1
And you think this is a good wine?,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.",1,1,1,1,1

I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable.",1,1,1,0,1

Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?,0,0,0,1,0

"Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don ’ t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it ’ s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I bloody it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That ’ s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.",0,1,0,0,0

"You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord.",1,1,1,1,1
Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage.,1,1,1,0,1
"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable. """,1,1,1,0,1
It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of' comfortable',1,1,1,0,0

"China is now a member of world trade organization. As a member of TO, China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members. Is it fair to China, do you think?",1,1,1,0,1
"It's a hard question, but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question. After the establishment of new China, our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy. These policies, however, favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises. After China's entry into TO, Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts. This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies. These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run.",1,1,1,0,1
We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement. This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise. Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, it does. Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises, regardless of their nationality and ownership. I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous, these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle. Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies.",1,1,1,0,1

Can you deliver them earlier?,0,0,0,0,0
I am afraid we can not do that. Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed?,0,1,0,0,1
"Possibly, subject to quality and delivery guarantees.",0,1,1,0,0

"I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial. As you know, we have long-time cooperation.",0,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid that's as far as we could go. We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit.,0,1,0,0,0

What ’ s the difference?,1,1,1,0,1

In addition to my analytical mindset, I have a background of solid accounting principles. I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills. I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments.",1,1,1,1,1
What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position?,0,1,1,0,1
"My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry. Most of my experience has been behind the scenes, doing the calculations. I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged.",1,1,1,0,1
Why did you leave your last position?,0,1,1,0,0
"I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to. I want to find a job that is stimulating, where I can grow.",1,1,1,1,1
What are your strengths and weaknesses?,1,1,1,0,1
"One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible. I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy. I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, and sometimes I put in too much time. But by being aware of my tendency to overwork, I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime.",1,1,1,0,1
How would your boss describe you and your work style?,1,1,1,0,1
"She'd say I have a lot of initiative, I see the big picture and I do what has to be done. Second, I always meet deadlines. If I say I'm going to do something, I do it. Lastly, I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted.",1,1,1,0,1

"In China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle. Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people.",1,1,1,0,1
"Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop. While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they are actually showing off!",0,1,1,0,0
"Yes. Behind a lifestyle, there is a culture. Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life. While they may not really like coffee, they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places.",0,0,0,0,0
"Then what about tea? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea, rather than coffee, has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture. While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft, elegant music, a teahouse is often a noisy, crowded, public space. People visit teahouses to associate with others, playing chess, chatting, or simply listening to operas.",1,1,1,1,1
"What a pity that the traditional teahouses, as depicted by Lao She, keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis. It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either. Teahouses of today all feature a cozy, comfortable environment, and high-quality services, but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, that's true. In a sense, it is not so much what you drink that really counts, as where and how you drink.",1,1,1,0,1
How about we taking a tour to Hawaii? I have a 2 - weeks' vacation.,1,1,1,1,1

What? What does that mean? Why won't there be any results?,0,0,0,0,0
"I hate to tell you this, but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire. There's nothing left. I'm so sorry...",0,1,0,0,0

"To get around your difficulty, Mr. Brown, I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half. You can send in an Addi trional order later.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I'll consider the possibility. By the way, when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June?",1,1,1,0,1
A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered.,1,1,0,0,1
Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly?,1,1,1,0,1

That'll be fine. I appreciate your cooperation.,1,1,1,0,1
"Very good. Well, thanks to your cooperation, our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful. I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future.",1,1,1,1,1
"By the way, Mrs. Wang, we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market. Would you entertain this proposal?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, this is something new. A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods. We think there are a lot of details to go into.",1,1,1,1,1
"If you feel our proposal is attractive, it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner.",1,1,1,0,1
"Naturally, I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts. But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today. I must first talk to our director, and discuss it with you some other time.",1,1,1,0,1
"All right. Anyway, I'll be staying here for another two weeks. But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect.",1,1,1,0,1

"Oh, really? Is it a good way?",1,1,1,0,0
"Yes, very gorgeous. Sometimes, I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house.",1,1,1,0,1
What advantages does it have?,1,1,1,0,1
"Firstly, it is convenient. And secondly, it has low cost, because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service.",1,1,1,0,1
I agree with you. It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition.,0,1,0,0,1
The most important is that it is very convenient. You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time. Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers.,1,1,1,1,1
"So cool, if we do business through other ways, it will cost a lot of time.",1,1,1,0,1
"Sure, but every coin has two sides. Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways.",0,1,0,0,0
Will you give me some suggestion?,1,1,1,0,0
"Of course, such as Alabama, which is a famous website.",1,1,1,0,1

"OK. The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet, and it is about selling medicines.",1,1,1,0,1
What do you think of this job?,1,1,1,0,1
"I am not familiar with the medicine industry, and I don't think it fits me well.",0,1,0,0,0
Then how about the others?,1,1,1,0,1
"Another is about electronic commerce, and its products are mainly large machinery equipments.",1,1,1,0,1
"I have heard about electronic commerce, and many people say it has good prospects for development.",1,1,1,0,1
I also feel it's nice. I want to give it a try.,1,1,1,1,1
Come on! I believe you will succeed.,1,1,1,1,1

I know. I should've called.,0,1,0,0,0
"Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside.",0,0,0,0,0
You want to throw me out over this?,0,0,0,0,0
"That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules.",0,0,0,0,0
"That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.",0,0,0,0,0
"You heard who won the election, didn ’ t you?",1,1,1,1,1

I sure did! What about you?,1,1,1,1,1
Of course I did!,1,1,1,1,1

"We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.",1,1,1,0,1
Would any of them have dancing figures?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.",1,1,1,0,1

One last question,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, no. Everything we sell here is ‘ as is.'",0,1,0,0,0
I guess I was asking for too much.,0,1,0,0,0
"If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.",1,1,1,0,1

"That's right. I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open, if you know what I mean.",1,1,1,0,1
I couldn't agree more. If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away. Is there anything else that you need from us today?,1,1,1,1,1

"I appreciate your remarks. And we are always happy to do more business.But, you know, if we take on a contract to produce new products, we want to be confident the product is marketable.

Of course. Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products.,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, of course.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So, Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo, but the products are very simple.",1,1,1,0,1
And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad.,1,1,1,0,1
That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great. It is really great. I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least. Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing.,1,1,1,1,1

"Yes, we would like to make things like key chains, plastic pencil sharpeners, plastic rulers, watches, wallets, things like that.Little accessories for young people. But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty.",1,1,1,1,1
I understand. But why won't you show me the logo?,0,1,1,0,0
"Because it hasn't been copyrighted. We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright, we are investigating companies to produce the products.",1,1,1,0,1
"I see. The problem, however, is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last.",0,1,1,0,0
"I understand. For now, though, you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet. We are just investigating. I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then, I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost.",1,1,1,0,1
Alright. I understand. Right now you just want estimates.,1,1,1,0,1
Yes.,0,1,0,0,0

"Yes, our delivery fee could be waived, if you make an order of 50 units or more. We would have to insist on the annual contract, however. I understand it's not the most convenient for you. Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate.",1,1,1,0,1
That would be fine. We could accept a lower rebate.,1,1,1,0,1

I know Mark is your only child. You may do it differently from what I did. Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles.,1,0,1,0,0
"I do it, too. You know, sometimes when we eat, my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat. And if it were something he doesn ’ t like, he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes. He does it very often. I really get mad. I can ’ t help spank him sometimes.",0,0,0,0,0
And what does your husband do?,1,1,1,1,1
My husband is an American. He criticizes me when I do that. He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force. He is learning what I am doing now.,0,0,1,0,0

Alright.,0,1,0,0,0
"Then, after you sand it, you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust.",1,1,1,0,1
Sawdust?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust. You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on.",1,1,1,0,1
That makes sense.,1,1,1,0,1
"Then you apply the varnish, which is very easy. It is like painting.",1,1,1,0,1
And I can choose any color?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, we have many colors to choose from, sir.",1,1,1,0,1
And after the varnish?,1,1,1,0,1

Dan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.,1,1,1,0,1
That would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It ’ s really annoying!,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah you are right. This office is falling apart! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded.,0,1,0,0,0
I know! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.,0,1,1,1,0
How long have you been in this company?,1,1,1,0,1
I came two years ago after I graduated from college. This is my first job.,1,1,1,0,1
You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college.,1,1,1,0,1
"Of course! Everyday, there is a deadline to meet. Bosses watching and testing me all the time, not liking in college, handed in paper months later and tested on schedule. It is so busy. But anyway, I have been trying my best to be a good employee.",0,1,0,0,1
"Well, you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well. Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years. What is your secret?",1,1,1,1,1
"It is so encouraging to hear this remark. The secret is to make plans. Write down your goals, short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month. Then just work hard.",1,1,1,1,1
How will you ship the order?,1,1,1,0,1
"Air freight is the quickest and safest way, I think.",1,1,1,0,1

"Yeah, I think so.",1,1,1,0,1
What are you going to get?,1,1,1,1,1
I'm not sure what we need.,0,1,1,0,0
Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator.,1,1,1,0,1
"Could you do it for me, and write out a list of things that we need?",1,1,1,0,1

The kitchen god? What does he do?,1,1,1,1,1
"He just stays in the kitchen and watches you. Before the Chinese New Year, the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year. Just like Lester does!",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no! I did a lot of bad things this year. I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody!",0,1,0,0,0
"Actually, there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did.",1,1,1,0,1
"What is it? Tell me! Will it work for Lester, too?",0,0,1,1,0
I think so! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week. That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you!,1,1,1,1,1
Hmm. Are you sure that will work? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester.,0,1,0,0,0
And what happened?,1,1,1,0,1

"Well, I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t. It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough. Would you mind changing?",0,1,0,0,0
"If it is not to your satisfaction, I ’ ll certainly bring you another. But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, that ’ s all right. Thank you very much.",1,1,1,0,1
"Judy, what do you think of the new general manager?",1,1,1,0,1
"He has extensive experience, although the guy ’ s really deep, sometimes, it scares me.",0,1,1,0,0
"I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go, so don ’ t provoke him.",0,0,0,0,0
"I know, and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance. It's safer that way.",1,1,0,0,1
"Me too, I don't know why, but every time I see the guy, I break into a cold sweat.",0,1,0,0,0
"It's in the eyes. They're the type that seems to look into your soul, making one really uneasy.",0,1,1,0,0
"Whatever we said, we must be more careful.",0,1,0,0,0

Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products.,1,1,1,1,1
"The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others. If you can manage to boost it a bit, we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount.",0,0,0,0,0
"As far as a trial order is concerned, the quantity is by no means small. And generally speaking, we like to profit from a trial order. I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, as this is the first deal between us, we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement.",1,1,1,1,1

Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged, around 40 to 50 or so. This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels, and have money to spend. They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer. They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything.",1,1,0,0,1

"Yes, I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department.",1,1,1,1,1
"I ’ m Smith, the manager of Human Resources Department. May I ask your name?",1,1,1,1,1
My name is Zhang Due.,1,1,1,0,1
Would you tell me what education background you have?,1,1,1,0,1
I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade. My major was International Trade.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you have any experience in this field?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years.",1,1,1,0,1
OK. Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes.,1,1,1,0,1
OK. I will accept you for a three months-period of probation. Is this satisfactory?,1,1,0,0,1
Yes.,1,1,1,0,1
Welcome to our factory.,1,1,1,1,1
I've been looking forward to visiting your factory.,1,1,1,1,1
"Actually, you'll know our products better after the visit. I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along.",1,1,1,1,1
That'll be most helpful.,1,1,1,0,1
Maybe we could start with the Design Department. And then we could look at the production line.,1,1,1,1,1
How much do you spend on design development every year.,1,1,1,0,1
About 10 % of the gross sales.,0,1,0,0,1
That's fine.,1,1,1,0,1
Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes?,1,1,0,0,1
"No, Nancy, today I'm here to make a withdrawal. I made a formal request 7 days ago.",0,0,0,0,1
"You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit, right?",1,1,1,0,1
"That's correct. But before I do, I was wondering if you could give me some advice.",1,1,1,0,1
"Of course, Mr Hayes. That's what I'm here for. What would you like to know?",1,1,1,1,1
Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity.,0,1,0,0,0
"This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity. Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account, for example?",0,1,0,0,1
"No, not really. My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it.",0,1,0,0,0
You would be using mainly English in this job. Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease?,1,1,1,0,0
"Yes, I think I speak English quite fluently. I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English. They say my English is quite good.",1,1,1,1,1
How many years have you been learning English?,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, more than ten years. I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it.",1,1,1,0,1
Certainly.,1,1,1,0,1
"Hi, I'm Benjamin. Nice to meet you here. You look great.",1,1,1,1,1
Thank you. Nice to meet you too. I'm John. Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, this is the second time. But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag.",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Take it easy. It will be OK soon. You see, I take this long-hour plane frequently, but the jet lag still makes me uneasy.",1,1,1,0,0
"Oh, that's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China?",0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most.",1,1,1,1,1
All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World.,1,1,1,0,1
Was it built before the In dynasty? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty.,1,1,1,0,1
"No, before the In dynasty.",0,1,0,0,1
"Oh, yeah. Thought I am an American, I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well.",1,1,1,1,1
Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health. And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China, I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them.",1,1,1,1,1
Do you like the Chinese traditional silk?,1,1,1,0,1
"I heard about it, but I don't have any clothes made from silk.",0,1,0,0,0
Go and pick some stuff up. The price can always surprise foreign friends.,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, I'm eager to have a try.",1,1,1,1,1
Hi. What can I get for you?,1,1,1,1,1
"I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef, please.",1,1,0,0,1
"Good choice! Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.",1,1,1,1,1
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts?,1,1,0,0,1
"No, no no no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.",1,1,1,0,1
"No, that won ’ t do. I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here.",0,0,0,0,1
"Okay, is there anything else?",1,1,1,0,1
Is this salami and bologna you have here?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes! It ’ s very fine meat! Made it myself...,1,1,1,1,1
"Sounds good. Okay, that ’ s it.",1,1,1,0,1
"Wait! We have T-bone, rib eye, and sirloin steaks. They are very fresh! Just came from the slaughter house...",1,1,1,1,1
"Mmm... No that ’ s okay, really. I think that ’ s all for today.",0,1,0,0,1
Okay. That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents.,1,1,0,0,1
I ’ m reporting from Channel 5 News.,1,1,1,1,1
How are you doing?,1,1,1,1,1
I want to ask you a couple questions.,1,1,1,0,1
Go for it.,1,1,1,1,1
Have you voted yet?,1,1,1,0,1
I voted this morning.,1,1,1,0,1
Who was your vote for President?,1,1,1,0,1
I can ’ t tell you that.,0,1,0,0,0
Why can ’ t you tell me?,0,0,0,0,0
That is private information.,0,0,0,0,0
I see.,0,1,0,0,0
All I can tell you is our next President got my vote.,1,1,1,0,1
"Billy, you don ’ t look too well. Maybe you should take the day off school.",0,1,1,0,0
But Mom! Today we ’ re playing football! I love football!,1,1,1,1,1
You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever. What ’ s that on your arm?,0,1,0,0,0
I don ’ t know. It was there when I woke up this morning.,0,1,0,0,0
It ’ s a rash. I ’ d better take you to see the doctor. How did you get that bruise on your leg?,0,1,1,0,1
I bashed it against the chair in my room.,0,0,0,0,0
Does it hurt?,0,1,0,0,0
"A little, but not much.",0,1,0,0,0
Here. Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down. I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast.,1,1,1,0,1
"If I ’ m better this afternoon, can I go to school?",1,1,1,0,0
"If you are better, but I doubt you will be.",0,0,0,0,0
"It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job. Susan, why do we need to find a job?",1,1,1,0,0
"We need to work is because we need money to live. We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house. We need money for many different things, and only when we work, we can earn money. And work can also help us feel that we are useful.",1,1,0,0,1
But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a job right now.,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it is really hard. But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally. When you work, you can accumulate a lot of experience. Besides, you need to learn a lot of things while you are working.",1,1,1,1,1
I've been fed up with study.,0,1,0,0,0
"But whether you like it or not, there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society. And you need to accept this concept positively.",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, my. Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation?",0,1,1,0,0
"You have no choice, so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time.",0,0,1,0,1
"Excuse me? Can you do me a favor, please?",1,1,1,0,1
"It's my pleasure, what can I do for you?",1,1,1,1,1
I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today.,1,1,1,0,1
What brings you here?,1,1,1,1,1
I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation.,1,1,1,1,1
Where are you staying?,1,1,1,0,1
I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, it's not very far. And as far as I know it is a fancy place.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, it is. Do you know where I can get a town map?",1,1,1,1,1
"We sell them, right here.",1,1,1,0,1
"Great, do you have any for foreigners? I mean English version?",1,1,1,1,1
I called about that ad we saw in the paper.,1,1,1,0,1
For the construction site manager?,1,1,1,0,1
That's the one.,1,1,1,0,1
What happened?,0,1,1,0,0
You were right. It was from a headhunter. She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, no surprise there.",0,1,0,0,0
"No! Not at all. But, I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work.",1,1,1,0,1
"Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them?",1,1,1,1,1
I'm going there tomorrow.,1,1,1,0,1
Great. Good luck.,1,1,1,0,1
Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, and I think I have good news for you.",1,1,1,1,1
Did they accept the counter-offer?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, they accepted your counter-offer, but they want you to pay for the home inspection.",1,1,0,0,1
How much will that cost?,0,1,0,0,0
It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection.,1,1,0,0,1
Can I choose the home inspector?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, you are paying for it, so you get to choose. I would pick the best one.",1,1,1,1,1
"So, when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance?",0,0,0,0,0
I will call the owners right now. They will be happy to hear the good news.,1,1,1,1,1
"This is our rock - bottom price, Mr. Li. We can't make any further concessions.",0,0,0,0,1
"If that's the case, there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off.",0,0,0,0,0
What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great.,0,1,0,0,0
I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price. How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded?,1,1,1,0,1
What is your proposal?,1,1,1,0,1
"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept. When I suggested we meet each other half way, I meant it literally.",0,0,0,0,0
Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? That's impossible.,0,0,0,0,0
What would you suggest?,1,1,1,0,1
The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars. That'll definitely be rock bottom.,0,1,0,0,0
"That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered. Let's meet each other half way once more, then the gap will be closed and our business completed.",1,1,1,0,1
"You certainly have a way of talking me into it. All right, let's meet half way again.",1,1,1,1,1
I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price. We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, there's one other point I wish to clear up.",1,1,1,0,1
What is it?,0,1,0,0,0
My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U. S. import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, they're right. In fact, we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade.",1,1,1,0,1
"I'm glad to hear that. With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties, and in particular, exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts, is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D. C.?",1,1,1,0,1
"Basically speaking, yes, we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D. C. Of course, there are more details to be attended to. We cannot settle it in a few words.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, of course. I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it. When do we meet again?",1,1,1,1,1
How about tomorrow morning at 9?,1,1,1,0,1
"Good. I'll come back tomorrow, and we can then discuss it more specifically.",1,1,1,0,1
"Good evening, may I help you?",1,1,1,1,1
Yes. I would like to book a table for 2 at 7:30 tomorrow evening.,1,1,0,0,1
"I am sorry, there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day.",0,1,0,0,0
"In that case, please put my name in your waiting list. We know you are quite a good restaurant.",1,1,1,0,1
"Thank you, sir. We will phone you as soon as we have a vacant table.",1,1,1,0,1
Mr. Smith just called me back.,1,1,0,0,1
So?,0,0,0,0,0
We got the contract!,1,1,1,1,1
All right!,1,1,1,1,1
What's wrong with you?,0,0,0,0,0
I feel so tired.,0,1,0,0,0
I really recommend you go for a run in the morning.,1,1,1,1,1
Why? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day.,0,1,0,0,0
On the contrary! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day.,1,1,1,1,1
Are you sure?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, I often feel like a million dollars after work, like I can take on anything.",1,1,1,1,1
OK. Let me try.,1,1,1,0,1
Welcome!,1,1,1,1,1
"Would you give me a bottle of beer, please?",1,1,1,0,1
"With ice, sir?",1,1,1,0,1
"No, ice will spoil the taste.",0,1,0,0,1
"Anything else, sir?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes. Something non-alcoholic, please.",1,1,1,0,1
"Fruit juice, milk or mineral water?",1,1,1,0,1
A glass of juice please.,1,1,0,0,1
Coming up immediately.,1,1,1,1,1
"Hello, 35..",1,1,0,0,1
Is this Ann?,1,1,1,0,1
Speaking.,1,1,1,0,1
"Ann, this is Sam. Look, Ann. I wanna see you again. How about a drink tonight?",1,1,1,1,1
I am sorry. I am very tired. I'm going to bed early.,0,1,0,0,0
What about tomorrow evening?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, I ’ m sorry. I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening. And I'm in a hurry now.",0,1,0,1,1
But Ann..,0,1,0,0,0
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles?,1,1,1,0,1
"In total, it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference. Would you like to see the breakdown?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I want to know exactly where the money is going. Give me a detailed report.",0,0,0,0,1
"First we have the airline tickets, which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going, that's t $ 2,000. For our accommodations, we're spending $ 80 a night, per room, for five days. That's another $ 800.",1,1,0,0,1
"Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive? We're sharing rooms, right?",0,1,0,0,0
"I have two people to a room. The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find. With the conference going on that week, all the hotels have inflated their prices, they're making a killing.",0,1,0,0,1
"So far we have $ 2,800, what else?",1,1,1,0,1
"I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses. That totals another $ 800. And for other incidentals, like take fees, and tips, I have estimated about $ 400.",1,1,0,0,1
"Well, that's only $ 4000. Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000? Where is the rest of the money?",0,0,0,0,0
"That's my buffer... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget, just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry.",1,1,0,0,1
Could you please stop flipping the channels?,0,0,0,0,0
I ’ m very sorry.,0,1,0,0,0
"Good morning, room reservations. Can I help you?",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, my name is Peter. I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st. I'd like to make some changes. The reservation should only be to June 20th.",1,1,1,0,1
A single room from June 18th to 20th. Is that correct?,1,1,0,0,1
Yes.,0,1,0,0,0
OK. Do you need a limousine service?,1,1,1,0,1
That's exactly what I want. How much does it charge?,1,1,1,1,1
A hundred and eighty yuan for one way. We have a counter at the airport where our representative will lead you to the car.,1,1,0,0,1
It sounds good. I'll take that.,1,1,1,1,1
"Thank you, sir. We look forward to serving you.",1,1,1,0,1
Hello!,1,1,1,1,1
Hello! Could I speak to Sheerly Lim please?,1,1,1,1,1
"Sure, just a second. Who's calling?",1,1,1,0,1
This is Sue from work.,1,1,0,0,1
"Ok, sue, I will just go in get her.",1,1,1,1,1
"Gosh, another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes, It's no quicker than a bus.",0,1,0,0,0
"That's true. During rush hours, taxis are just as quick as buses.",1,1,1,0,1
It was silly of me to have taken a taxi.,0,1,0,0,0
"At least, it can free you from the crowd. By the way, do you come from China?",1,1,1,1,1
"No, from New Zealand, sir. I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there.",1,1,1,1,1
"Wow, like America. It receives a great number of visitors every year.",1,1,1,1,1
"The more the world becomes open, the more people become international!",1,1,1,1,1
I have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house.,0,1,0,0,0
Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking you should offer?,1,1,1,1,1
I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more.,1,0,0,1,1
It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?,1,1,1,0,1
I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer.,0,1,1,0,0
Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer.,1,1,1,0,1
Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance?,1,1,1,0,0
It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer.,1,1,1,0,1
Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready?,1,1,0,0,0
The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified for your loan.,1,1,1,0,1
Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?,1,1,1,0,1
"We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations.",1,1,1,0,1
What exactly does that mean?,0,1,1,0,0
"Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim.",1,1,1,0,1
That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?,1,1,1,1,1
"If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations.",1,1,1,0,1
"Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?",1,1,1,0,1
"To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7a. m. till 10.",1,1,0,0,1
I'll go down there as soon as I can!,1,1,1,1,1
I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim stations.,1,1,1,1,1
"So that will be one teddy, two terry cloth robes, three pairs of satin slippers, and two pairs of pajamas.",1,1,1,0,1
"Does all that come to 10,000 NT?",1,1,0,0,1
"Let me see... yes, 15,880 NT. After the discount, your total comes to 12,704 NT. Here's your free teddy bear, free panties and your card application.",1,1,1,1,1
Where do I sign?,1,1,0,0,1
Right here. And write your address. You'll get the card in the mail within a week.,1,1,1,0,1
OK.,1,1,1,0,1
"I know your friend will like the gift set, especially the teddy bear.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, the teddy bear is for me!",1,1,1,0,1
Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges. There are no refunds on sale items.,1,1,0,0,1
"My name ’ s Terry Graham. You ’ re new around here, huh?",1,1,1,1,1
Yes. My name ’ s Mark Benson. I just started a couple of weeks ago.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, if there ’ s anything I can do for you, let me know.",1,1,1,1,1
"Thanks, I appreciate that!",1,1,1,0,1
Welcome back.,1,1,1,1,1
It's good to be home.,1,1,0,0,1
Why do you want to be a teacher?,1,1,1,0,1
"It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years. While it is difficult, I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession.",1,1,1,0,1
Do you know about our school?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, a little. I know your school is one of the best known in this town. There are about 200 children in the school.",1,1,1,0,1
There's someone coming.,1,1,1,0,1
It took them four minutes to get here. That was pretty fast.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, it's fast. But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage.",0,0,0,0,0
I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning.,0,1,0,0,0
I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this. Do you know them well?,1,1,1,0,0
Not really.,0,1,0,0,0
Do you know where they're vacationing?,1,1,1,1,1
"I think they went to Mexico, but I'm not sure.It' s a bad thing to return home to.They' ll come home from their trip, and they'll see half their house burned.",0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, but at least this way no one gets hurt.It' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home. Don't you think?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I suppose. It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping.",0,1,0,0,0
Can I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
I'd like to buy a skirt.,1,1,1,0,1
What style would you prefer?,1,1,1,1,1
I like one with flowers on its brim.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you like this one?,1,1,1,0,1
It seems too short.,0,1,0,0,0
What about this one?,1,1,1,0,1
It looks nice. How much is it?,1,1,1,0,1
70 yuan.,0,1,0,0,1
Is there any cheaper one?,0,1,1,0,0
This one is only 50 yuan.,1,1,1,0,1
I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now. It is better than this one although this one is cheaper.,1,1,1,0,1
All right.,0,1,0,0,0
Here is the money.,1,1,0,0,1
Thank you. Anything else?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, thanks.",0,1,0,0,0
"Walter, did you email that document to Mr. Lin yesterday?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I did, Ms. Chen.",1,1,0,0,1
"That's strange. I have Mr. Lin on the phone right now, and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday. Are you sure you sent it?",0,1,0,0,0
"I'm positive, Ms. Chen.",1,1,1,1,1
Here is an invitation for you.,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, thank you. What is the occasion?",1,1,1,0,1
Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company. Our general manager invites you to a dinner party. Do you think you can manage it?,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, yes, I'd very much like to go.",1,1,1,1,1
That is great. Dinner starts at 6,1,1,1,1,1
I'll be there in time.,1,1,1,0,1
All right. Bye.,1,1,0,0,1

Is Mr Li in?,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, but let me check if he's available.",1,1,1,0,1
Ok.,0,1,0,0,0
your mp3 looks so cool. Where did you get it?,1,1,1,1,1
I bought it online.,1,1,1,0,1
really? Do you often shop online?,1,1,1,1,1
yes. I buy most of my daily necessities online.,1,1,1,0,1
I've never tried E-shopping. Is it better than shopping at an actual store?,1,1,1,0,0
"yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home.",1,1,1,0,1
"sounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier.",1,1,1,0,1
"and you can still go "" window shopping "" just like in a real shopping mall.",1,1,1,1,1
"well, are there any other advantages?",1,1,1,0,1
"yes, most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.",1,1,1,0,1
are there many choices of online shopping?,1,1,1,1,1

perhaps I should have a try.,1,1,1,0,0
"I'll have a whole-wheat loaf, three white loaves, a baguette and ten rolls, please. How much is that?",1,1,1,1,1
"The whole-wheat loaf is 45 cents, the white loaves are 35 cents each, the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each. That makes two dollars fifty-seven cents.",1,1,0,0,1
There you go.,1,1,1,0,1
"Thank you, ma'am. Forty-three cents change. Have a nice day.",1,1,0,0,1
I feel dizzy and I have a headache.,0,1,0,0,0
How long have you been sick?,0,1,1,0,0

I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much.,1,1,1,1,1
I'm glad you appreciate our folk music. But a live performance is much more interesting.,1,1,1,1,1
I can't wait anymore. When does the performance start?,0,0,0,1,0
The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p. m.,1,1,1,0,1

"I'm glad you enjoyed it. It's had long run, but the house has always been full.",1,1,1,1,1
What do you think of the leading actors?,1,1,1,1,1
Personally I liked the main character. He was true to type.,1,1,1,0,1
You are a better judge. I don't know the play well enough.,1,1,1,0,0
Are you OK?,1,1,1,0,1
I'm fine. I'm just so touched by the sad story.,0,1,1,0,0
So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera. Which scene is your favorite?,1,1,1,1,1
"I love them all. But if I had to name one as the best, I would say it's the ending.",1,1,1,1,1
"What's it about? You know, I couldn't help falling asleep.",0,1,0,0,0
"Did you? I didn't notice that. But still you should know it, for you have seen it with Laura before.",1,1,1,0,1
"I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her, too. I mean falling asleep. For me, this one is not that attractive.",0,1,0,0,0
Then I doubt if you like operas at all.,0,0,0,0,0
Yes. I like Carmen very much. But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one.,1,1,1,0,1
"OK, then. The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave, with a rose in his hand. When he got there, he saw someone already put a rose on her grave.",0,1,0,0,0
Very impressive. And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice.,1,1,1,1,1

"And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting, and music. Just amazing!",1,1,1,1,1
"No doubt, it's not a simple thing to put on a' phantom show'.",0,1,1,0,0
Exactly.,1,1,1,0,1
I need a taxi to the airport.,1,1,0,0,1

Good afternoon. What can I do for you?,1,1,1,1,1
I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here.,1,1,1,1,1
About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg. It bled a lot.,0,1,0,0,0
Let me have a look. You're very lucky because the cut is not deep.,1,1,1,0,1
"First, I'll clean up the wound and then dress it.",1,1,1,0,1
Must I stop all my training? Will I be able to attend the games?,0,1,0,0,0
Take it easy. It's not serious. You should keep the wound very clean.,1,1,1,0,1

"Of course, come in.",1,1,1,1,1
Oh this is the new little EEE notebook from Asks. How much did you pay?,1,1,1,1,1
It was only 345 pounds.,0,1,0,0,1
Very nice. I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time.,1,1,1,1,1
"I am on my way to the doctor now, but I should be back in about 45 minutes. Can I come back at around 3:15?",1,1,1,0,1
That will be perfect.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm planning on going to the market soon.,1,1,1,0,1
What are you buying?,1,1,1,1,1
I don't know what we need.,0,1,0,0,0
"I can check for you, if you'd like.",1,1,1,0,1
I'll make a list.,1,1,1,0,1

I want it short.,0,0,0,0,1

"Oh, I see. You like the Chinese style, don't you?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, in the Chinese style.",1,1,1,0,1
"Would you like to have a shampoo, sir?",1,1,1,1,1
"No, thank you.",0,1,0,0,1
How about oil or spray?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, nothing of the kind.",0,1,0,0,0
There! How is that?,1,1,1,1,1
That's very good!,1,1,1,1,1
Hello. Do you like this jewelry? I made most of these items myself.,1,1,1,1,1
You really have talent. How did you learn to do this?,1,1,1,1,1
My mother taught me some tricks of the trade. I've always loved jewelry.,1,1,1,1,1
"Me, too. But I could never make bracelets like these.",1,1,1,0,0
I've been making these designs for over ten years. You can have a bracelet for ten dollars.,1,1,1,0,1

I'm sorry. I can't. What does the note say?,0,1,0,0,0
It says' No smoking'.,0,1,0,0,1
"Sorry, I'm very near sighted.",0,1,0,0,0
I called about that ad we saw in the paper.,1,1,1,0,1
For the bank manager?,1,1,1,0,1
That ’ s the one.,1,1,1,0,1
What happened?,0,1,1,0,0
"You were right, it was from a headhunter. He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, no surprise there.",0,1,0,0,0
"No! Not at all. But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work out.",1,1,1,0,1
"Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them?",1,1,1,1,1
I ’ m going there tomorrow.,1,1,1,0,1
Great! Good luck.,1,1,1,1,1
"And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown, to see what they have.",1,1,1,1,1
"Good idea. The more people you ask, the better your chances are.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hello! I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband.",1,1,1,0,1
There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your laptop.,1,1,1,0,1
Uh-oh! I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only.,0,1,1,0,0
That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have.,1,1,1,1,1
Any alternative that works will be great.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.",1,1,1,0,1
That sounds good. What's the charge?,1,1,1,0,1
"The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you print.",1,1,1,0,1
"That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?",1,1,1,1,1
"Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here.",1,1,1,1,1
"Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something there?",1,1,1,1,1
"They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the lab.",1,1,0,0,1
I have to do some shopping.,1,1,1,0,1
What are you going to look for?,1,1,1,0,1
I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set.,1,1,1,0,1
What store are you going to?,1,1,1,0,1
I'm not sure.,0,1,0,0,0
You don't know?,0,0,0,0,0
I have no idea where to find one.,0,1,0,0,0
Would you like me to tell you where I got mine.,1,1,1,1,1
I would appreciate that.,1,1,1,0,1
I went to get mine from IKEA.,1,1,1,0,1
Is the furniture at IKEA cheap?,1,1,1,0,1

Hello! How do I get online with my laptop?,1,1,1,1,1

No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives.,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are.",1,1,1,1,1
Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.,1,1,1,0,1
Great! But is it free?,1,1,1,0,1
"Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee.",1,1,0,0,1
You said there were other alternatives?,1,1,1,0,1
Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless.,1,1,1,1,1
Okay. That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the lobby?,1,1,1,1,1
"We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to the lab.",1,1,1,0,1
Why have you decided to change jobs?,1,1,1,0,1
"I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field. Since my major was international banking, I really hope to work at a bank.",1,1,1,0,1
"Then, why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai?",1,1,1,0,1
"Because your bank is a new one, I think I'll be given more opportunities, and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here.",1,1,1,1,1
It certainly is. But the work is also hard here. You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field.,0,1,0,0,1
"I expect to work hard, madam.",1,1,0,0,1
Do you mind going on frequent business trips?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, I enjoy travelling.",1,1,1,1,1
One of my students told me she was very depressed today.,0,1,0,0,0
Why?,0,1,1,0,0
Her father is dying.,0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, that ’ s very sad.",0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, she ’ s broken up about it, poor kid.",0,1,0,0,0
What did you do?,1,1,1,0,1
"I talked to her for a while, but she ’ s really depressed. So, I made an appointment with the school counselor for her.",0,1,1,0,1
That ’ s a good idea. The counselor is a psychologist. He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, that ’ s what I told her. I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help, instead of trying to deal with this on her own.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, me too.",1,1,1,0,1
I'm very annoyed at your disobedience.,0,0,0,0,0
"But mum, I didn't mess it up.",0,0,0,0,0
You should have asked for my opinion before you did it.,0,0,0,0,0
"Sorry, mum. I won't do it again.",0,1,0,0,0
You'd better remember your promise.,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us.,1,1,1,0,1

We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock.,1,1,0,0,1
That's great! Thank you very much.,1,1,1,1,1
Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market. We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent.,1,1,1,1,1
"We appreciate your intention, but the amount of your orders last year was moderate.",0,1,0,0,0
"That's true. However at the Fair last March, people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase.",1,1,1,1,1
Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent?,1,1,1,0,1
"I'm sure it will, if we are appointed your agent. Your garments are attractive, and we, a well-established importer with multiple sales channels, can boost the sales.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, we'll consider your proposal.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hey, don ’ t walk on the lawn.",0,0,0,0,0

You lost your wallet? Anything important in it?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. A lot of cash. Almost forty thousand pounds.,1,1,0,0,1
"Oh, I ’ m sorry to hear that. I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there.",0,1,1,0,1
It seems that is a better way. Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
You are welcome.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm so tired! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture.,0,1,0,0,0
the professor is a bit boring today. You need something to perk yourself up. How about a coffee?,0,1,1,1,1
"I don't really like coffee, to be honest. It's too bitter for me.",0,1,1,0,1
"well, you need something to wake you up. How about a soda?",1,1,1,1,1
most some drinks have too much sugar in them.,0,1,0,0,0
"the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them, which one would you like?",1,1,1,1,1
I like diet sprite. Does that have any caffeine in it?,1,1,1,0,1
"unfortunately, it doesn't. how about some diet coke?",0,1,1,0,0
I don't care for coke. I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine. What else has caffeine?,0,1,1,0,0
maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte;  they taste much better than plain brewed coffee.,1,1,1,1,1
maybe. How about a mochaccino? Are they any good?,1,1,1,0,0
you'll love that. It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup.,1,1,1,1,1
"that's perfect! Would you like one, too? My treat.",1,1,1,1,1
"thanks, but I'll stick with some jasmine tea. I'm trying to watch my diet.",1,1,0,0,1
"Hey, let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight.",1,1,1,1,1
That ’ s a good idea. I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack. The old one is hanging on by a thread!,1,1,1,0,1
That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend.,1,1,1,1,1
Shall we share a taxi?,1,1,1,1,1
Where are you heading now?,1,1,1,1,1
I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road. It is very close to your house.,1,1,1,1,1
Is that the university next to the Teachers' College?,1,1,1,0,1
That's the one.,1,1,1,0,1
You mean we'll share the taxi?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah. If we share the cab, it'll be cheaper. Besides that your Chinese is better than mine. The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well. Don't worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you.",1,1,1,1,1
Did you go to the basketball game on Friday?,1,1,1,1,1

So what was the score?,1,1,1,0,1
The score was 101-98.,0,1,0,0,1

Good morning. What seems to be the problem?,1,1,1,1,1
"Good morning, doctor. I feel terrible. I ’ Ve god a cold and I have a rash here on my neck. I ’ m not sleeping well either. What do you think the problem could be?",0,1,0,0,0
I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason. Have you been taking anything for your cold?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s. I ’ Ve been taking it for three days.",1,1,0,0,0
"Good. I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger. It will make you feel drowsy, so you certainly should rest.",1,1,1,0,1
OK. I can afford to take a few days off work.,1,1,1,0,1
Have you been working hard recently?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I have. I had to get a project finished. It ’ s done now, so I can relax a little.",1,1,1,0,1
"Good. Let ’ s take a look at that rash... it looks worse than it is. I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it. If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days, come back and see me. Do you have any other symptoms?",1,1,1,0,1
"I have a bad headache, but...",0,1,0,0,0
"Don ’ t worry about that. It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under. Just take some aspirin. Combined with the stronger cough medicine, it will make you feel very tired. You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration. If I were you, I ’ d just sleep, read a book, or watch TV. Here is your prescription.",1,1,1,0,1
Thanks doctor. I ’ ll get these immediately. Goodbye.,1,1,1,0,1

"Oh, my dear lady, take it easy. You should forgive a green hand like him.",1,1,1,0,1
He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy.,0,0,0,0,0
I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.,1,1,1,1,1
"I've told him how to do that several times, but he's never listened to me.",0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend, not a boss.",1,1,1,1,1

Hello. What can I do for you today?,1,1,1,1,1

Really? Have you checked everything carefully?,0,1,1,0,0
"Very carefully, that's when I found the problem.",1,1,1,0,1
"Ah, I see. The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting, right?",0,1,1,0,0
"Yep, you've got it! What should we do?",1,1,1,1,1
"Usually, if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that. But this does seem a little more serious.

it's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.,1,1,1,0,1
"I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.",0,1,0,0,0
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.,1,1,1,0,1
I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.,1,1,1,0,1
"it would be better for the environment, too.",1,1,1,0,1
I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.,0,1,1,0,0
taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.,1,1,1,0,1
the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.,0,1,0,0,0
"well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.",1,1,1,1,1
that's true. I could certainly use the exercise!,1,1,1,1,1
"so, are you going to quit driving to work then?",1,1,1,0,1
"yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.",0,1,0,0,0

I see. Why did you choose our company?,1,1,1,0,1
"I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company. Besides, I grew up in a city in the Northeast. I have lots of acquaintances in the region, which might help to push sales.",1,1,1,1,1

Really? How to do that?,1,1,1,0,0
"Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell, then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number. Then your stuff will be sold by auction.",1,1,1,0,1
"That's amazing. I'd love to try it later. Oh, an on-line virtual supermarket?",1,1,1,1,1
Let's click to check it out.,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, I got it. It simulates the real supermarket, which makes it feel so real. Mom will love it. She loves shopping in supermarkets.",1,1,1,1,1

What do you think are the main causes of war today?,1,1,1,0,1
"I ’ d say the main reason is poverty. Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little. If their neighbors have some resources, they try to steal them by military force.",0,0,0,0,0
It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars. People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country.,0,0,1,0,0
several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end.,0,1,0,0,0
How do you think they could be ended?,1,1,1,0,0
I don ’ t think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real pro,0,1,1,0,0
"So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a programme to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them.",1,1,1,0,1
"It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it ’ s harder to make peace between countries.",0,1,0,0,0
Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive.,1,1,1,0,1
The problem is that many poor people might suffer.,0,1,1,0,0
"Hello, it's nice to meet you.",1,1,1,1,1

Maybe the compressor is going bad.,0,1,0,0,0
Can you send the technician to check it out?,0,1,0,0,1
"Sure. But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit. If your freezer needs parts, there will be an additional charge.",0,1,0,0,1

"Yes, table etiquette. There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told. Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners, while they are the norm in China. Hey, your chopsticks, old silly! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow!",1,1,1,0,1
Anything strange about that?,0,1,1,0,0
"Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate. They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices. It's very inauspicious, and might enrage all present.",0,0,0,0,0

"I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education, because I want a student visa.",1,1,1,0,1
Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected?,0,1,1,0,0
I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents. The embassy is very strict about it. You have to be quite careful.,0,1,0,0,1
Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities?,0,0,1,0,0
That ’ s simple. Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions.,0,1,1,0,1

so did i. I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people.,1,1,1,1,1
so what happened in the meeting?,1,1,1,0,1
one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well. That was to be expected. The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting.,0,0,0,0,0
"I wonder why not. We could always revise the suggestions, to take into account any objections.",1,1,1,0,1
"that ’ s good advice, but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted.",0,1,0,0,0
may I make a suggestion?,1,1,1,0,1
sure. I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions.,1,1,1,1,1
"Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think? If they like your ideas, perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals. You won ’ t get credit for ide",0,1,1,0,0
I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea.,0,1,0,0,0
go on. Take a chance. You could just hint at your idea. The client should be smart enough to take a hint.,1,1,1,1,1
that was a great dinner. I didn't know that you knew how yo cook.,1,1,1,1,1

How about your other siblings? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents?,1,1,1,1,1
"Two of my sisters still live at home, even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs. They enjoy spending their free time with my parents. I guess in that respect, I'm the black sheep of the family.",0,1,0,0,0
I see. Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often?,1,1,1,0,1
"They're always asking me to come home, but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other. Whenever we see each other, all we do is fight.",0,0,1,0,0

I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator.,0,1,0,0,0

"I'm dead serious. They've decided that it's too small to be a planet, but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore.",0,1,1,0,1
That sounds crazy. They can't just change their mind about things like that.,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, they can. If you remember correctly, people used to believe that the world was flat.",1,1,1,0,1
"I suppose you're right. They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them, not the other way around.",0,1,1,0,0
We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos.,0,1,1,0,0
Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation?,1,1,1,1,1
I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space?,1,1,1,1,1
I hope not. I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth.,0,0,0,0,0

"I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume. In fact, I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year. I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well. Here is the recommendation.",1,1,1,0,1
You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English.,1,1,1,0,1
"No problem. The professional English course is just English for Accounting. Moreover, as you know, the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture. When I served part-time there, I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English.",1,1,1,0,1
That sounds fine. Why did you choose to apply to our company?,1,1,1,0,1
I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department. Her name is Lilling. She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested. I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company.,1,1,1,1,1
Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees?,1,1,1,0,1

"I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association, but the certificate won't come to hand until next month. How about that?",1,1,1,0,1
I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July.,1,1,0,0,1
"Thank you, Mrs Smith. It is really a pleasure talking with you.",1,1,1,1,1

I'll get them back right away.,1,1,1,0,1
My goodness! My silk dress is shrunk. How did you wash it?,0,1,0,0,0
It was washed by washing machine.,1,1,0,0,1
It should be handwashed with cold water. It's a common sense. Don't you know it?,0,0,0,0,0
I'm so sorry. I have no idea of it. I washed silk dress the first time. I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money.,1,1,1,0,0
That's all right. Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time. You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind. I think it fits you.,1,1,1,1,1
It's very nice of you. I'll try my best to do my job well.,1,1,1,0,1
When do you go to bed usually?,1,1,1,0,1

"You are from Japan, aren't you?",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, yes!",1,1,1,1,1
I love Japan a lot.,1,1,1,1,1

Did you hear about last night's blackout?,0,1,1,0,0
Yes. The lights were out all night.,0,1,0,0,0
Some people went looting because of the blackout.,0,0,0,0,0
What do you mean?,0,1,1,0,0
People decided to use the blackout to their advantage.,1,1,1,0,1
People went out and looted?,0,0,0,0,0
I guess they broke into about four stores.,0,1,0,0,0
Did the police find who did it?,0,1,0,0,0
There's no evidence of who it was.,0,1,0,0,0
I hope we don't have any more blackouts.,0,1,0,0,0
Would you please bring me the black suit? I want to try it on.,1,1,1,0,1

I think this suit fits perfectly.,1,1,1,0,1

It's fine. Please wrap it.,1,1,1,0,1
Excuse me.,1,1,1,0,1
Yes?,0,1,0,0,0
Could I have one more blanket?,1,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid there aren't any left at the moment. Gan you wait just a little while?,0,1,0,0,0
OK. I will.,1,1,1,0,1
I'll bring you one as soon as I find one available.,1,1,1,0,1
"Would you, please? Thank you.",1,1,1,0,1
"I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here.",0,1,1,0,0
"This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym.",1,1,0,0,1
Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?,0,0,0,0,0
You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill.,1,1,1,0,1
All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?,1,1,1,0,0
The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge.,1,1,1,0,1
Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?,1,1,1,0,1
"They're available anytime between 7 a. m. and 10 p. m., seven days a week.",1,1,1,0,1
Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!,1,1,1,1,1

Um. Ten?,0,1,0,0,0
"Get in this door young man. It ’ s midnight, you are two hours past curfew.",0,0,0,0,0
"I know, but it wasn ’ t my fault! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn ’ t leave the party!",0,0,0,0,0
"I don ’ t care! You are grounded for life, mister!",0,0,0,0,0
Mom! That is so unfair!,0,0,0,0,0
You know the rules and you broke them. No allowance and no TV for a week. I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down!,0,0,0,0,0
What! For being a couple of hours late? You have to be kidding!,0,0,0,0,0
I don ’ t want to hear it! Now go to your room!,0,0,0,0,0
See how many people are here!,1,1,1,1,1
Yeah! Do all these people work in the company? Everyone and their dog is here!,1,1,1,1,1
"Other than the employees, our boss Jack invited some friends of the company.",1,1,1,1,1
Can we just sit wherever we want?,1,1,1,1,1
Of course not! We have to sit at our assigned seats. I think our table is over there in the back.,0,1,0,0,1
"Hmm. We don't exactly have the best seats in the house, do we?",0,1,0,0,0
Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing!,1,1,1,1,1

"I understand. But unfortunately, it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line. You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals. We also consider other elements, including design and practicality. We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company.",0,1,0,0,1
Do you have any price range? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high?,1,1,1,0,0
We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint. That's all I can say.,1,1,1,0,1
"So, Monica, how do you like your new office?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, I love it. The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine. There are plants along the corridor. Especially, I got my own desk with computer and telephone. Such a great place!",1,1,1,1,1
That ’ s very good. I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful.,0,1,0,0,0
What was so bad about it?,0,1,1,0,0
"Small rooms, small window, a small desk shared by three people. I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work.",0,1,0,0,0
Sounds bad! Lucky you! You didn ’ t take that job. I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently.,0,1,1,0,1
"Totally agree. By the way, the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506. You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor.",1,1,1,1,1
"John, do you have a minute?",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, hi, Leo. Sure, what ’ s up?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office.",0,1,1,0,0
But I ’ m not in there very often. It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work.,0,1,0,0,0
"That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at. We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office, but have you noticed? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course. A lot people are going in and out.",0,0,1,0,0
Has anybody spoken to him about it?,0,1,1,0,0
"No, not yet, but someone ’ s going to have to.",0,1,0,0,0
"We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help, can we?",0,1,0,0,0
"No, of course not. But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you.",0,0,0,0,0
How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall?,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, that would be too small.",0,1,0,0,0
"With the cabinets taken out, it might be bigger than it looks.",1,1,1,0,1
"Come to think of it, you may be on to something. Let ’ s go have a look.",1,1,1,1,1
Let's rock n' roll.,1,1,1,1,1
"Ok, let ’ s go through this one more time. I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses!",0,0,0,0,0
"I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine.",0,1,0,0,0
"Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.",1,1,1,0,1
"So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?",0,1,1,0,0
"Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.",1,1,1,0,1
Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right?,1,1,1,1,1
"No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.",0,0,0,0,1
You know what? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned.,1,1,1,0,1
Why am I being arrested?,0,0,0,0,0
You have a warrant out for your arrest.,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have a warrant.,0,1,0,0,0
My computer shows that you have a bench warrant.,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know what a bench warrant is.,0,1,1,0,0
You apparently missed a court appearance.,0,0,0,0,0
I was never told to go to court.,0,1,0,0,0
There's nothing I can do about that.,0,1,0,0,0
This isn't fair.,0,0,0,0,0
That's life.,0,1,0,0,0
What about my rights?,0,0,0,0,0
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.,0,0,0,0,0
"Alright, tell me what you think about this one.",1,1,1,1,1
Don't you think it's a bit bright?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, maybe you're right. How about this outfit?",1,1,1,1,1
"That dress looks lovely on you, but it's not very practical, is it?",1,1,0,0,1
"No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just want to try it on! What do you think about this? It's casual, yet sophisticated.",1,1,1,1,1
"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It's too plain on its own.",0,1,1,0,1
"How about this scarf, these earrings, and an anklet?",1,1,1,1,1
That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet?,0,1,1,0,1
That's a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.,1,1,1,1,1
"Thanks. You'd be OK on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",1,1,1,1,1
Yep. Here it is. What do you think?,1,1,1,1,1
That looks great. Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them?,1,1,1,1,1
"The leopard print sounds fabulous. OK, I'll take it.",1,1,1,1,1

"Yes, what's your name?",1,1,1,1,1
What can I do for you today?,1,1,1,1,1
It's a little embarrassing really;  you see I think I've got a counterfeit note.,0,1,0,0,0
Do you remember where you got it?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, I don't. Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given, but for some reason this one slipped through.",0,1,0,0,0
Counterfeit notes these days can be very sophisticated and difficult to spot with the naked eye. But I must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit I have no option but to confiscate it.,0,0,0,0,1
"I understand. To be honest, I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake.",1,1,1,0,1
The machine shows it to be counterfeit. You'll need to fill in this form and I'll give you a receipt to show the money has been confiscated.,0,1,0,0,1

are the rooms nice and bright?,1,1,1,0,1

do you have a balcony?,1,1,1,0,1
"no, we don ’ t. we wish we had one. That ’ s the only thing we wanted, but don ’ t have. The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly.",1,1,1,0,0

We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things.,1,1,1,1,1

"You've got to, I'm afraid. And look at this. You weigh 200 stones. That's too much for a man of your size.",0,0,0,0,0

What does it include?,0,1,1,0,0
The facial will start with a thorough cleansing.,1,1,1,0,1
Does it include a facial mask and a massage?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. The stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin. You can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well.,1,1,1,1,1
Will you exfoliate the skin as well?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. We'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun.,1,1,1,1,1
That sounds great. I'll have that one then.,1,1,1,1,1
"Ok, just follow me.",1,1,1,1,1

I'm more than happy having her in my class.,1,1,1,1,1
Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country?,1,1,1,1,1
"Our country is a free trade nation. She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy. Parallel to this, her dependence upon foreign trade has increased. Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials, semi-finished products and capital goods. Thus. in many fields, our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries. But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market, because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, what about price?",0,1,1,0,0
"The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries. Of course, marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price. There are also other important factors such as design, quality of goods, terms of sale, transport and insurance.",1,1,1,0,1
"Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you?",1,1,1,1,1

"Since everyone is different, your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level. Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal.",1,1,1,1,1
Sounds pretty good. How much do you charge?,1,1,1,0,1
"That depends. We offer membership for one month, half a year and one year.",1,1,1,0,1
Perhaps one month. I'll just have a try at first.,1,1,1,0,0
Wise decision. that is 400 yuan. You'll find it's totally worth it.,1,1,1,1,1
"OK, I'll take it.",1,1,1,0,1
Watch out! You're too close to the fire place.,0,0,0,0,0

I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator.,1,1,1,0,1
"Ah yes, that is a great refrigerator.",1,1,1,0,1
What's so great about it?,0,1,0,0,0

What appliances?,0,1,0,0,0
"It comes with an ice maker, water dispenser, and there is a lot of room inside.",1,1,1,0,1
May I see the inside for myself?,1,1,1,0,1

You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe. When is it that you are leaving?,1,1,1,1,1
"In just three weeks, and I am excited. But there are still a few things I need to do before I go.",1,1,1,1,1
Like what?,0,1,1,0,0
"Like renewing my passport, going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone.",1,1,1,0,1
"You are not going to give it up, are you?",0,0,0,0,0
"No way. I ’ ll never find another apartment around here. But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment, either.",0,1,0,0,0
I don ’ t blame you. Perhaps you could sublet it.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, but whom to?",0,1,0,0,0
"Mmm... let me think. Oh, I know just a person. An old colleague of mine, Jim Thomas, is coming here to do some research this summer, from June to August.",1,1,1,1,1
"That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away. It sounds ideal, as long as the landlord agrees.",1,1,1,0,1
"Tell you what, I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway, so I ’ ll mention it to him then.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, thanks, Bill. Let me know what happens. That extra money will really come in handy.",1,1,1,0,1
I like chess better than xiangqi. And you?,1,1,1,1,1
"For my part, xiangqi. Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese.",1,1,1,0,1
"I think chess is more reasonable. You see, each side has eight pawns, a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi. A true battle should be like that. Soldiers should outnumber the commanders.",1,1,1,0,1
"Quite right. And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi, the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank. It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance.",1,1,1,0,1
"Correct! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king. It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent. They are required to stay in the palace, waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards. Look at the king in chess, he is much more capable.",0,0,1,0,0
"Yeah, and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards, he has a queen who is the most powerful piece. I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China.",1,1,1,1,1
"There's another distinctive contrast. Both board games use a total of 32 pieces, but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board, bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess.",1,1,1,0,1
"You mean, xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around?",1,1,1,0,1
"Sure. On a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. It has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces-chariots, horses and bishops-can cover longer distances.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, what about this two-bedroom apartment? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city, just steps from the metro.",1,1,1,1,1
"Wow, that would be very convenient. How much is the rent?",1,1,1,1,1
"It says it's $ 1600. But if you share it with another person, that's only $ 800 per month.",1,1,1,0,1
That definitely sounds like a steal. I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well.,1,1,1,1,1
That's true. I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there.,1,1,1,1,1
Professor wang can I ask a few questions?,1,1,1,0,1

What is the tariff?,0,1,0,0,0
It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country.,0,1,0,0,1
Why does the government levy the tariff?,0,1,1,0,0
Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue.,1,1,1,0,1
Anything else.,0,1,0,0,0
Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods.,0,1,0,0,1

Do not mention it.,0,1,0,0,0

Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on?,0,1,0,0,0
"If your plugs aren't connected all the way, the computer won't turn on.",0,1,0,0,1
I had no idea.,0,1,0,0,0

That's amazing! Really? How could it change so much in two days?,1,1,1,1,1
My stomach's growling again!,0,1,0,0,0

"Most models only eat once a day. If they can do it, so can we.",1,1,1,0,1
"You know. Soup, well, society makes us like this.",0,1,1,0,0
I think you're hallucinating! What are you talking about?,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thin is always "" in "" with the media.",0,1,0,0,0
And your point is?,0,0,0,0,0
"if you aren't thin, you're nobody.",0,0,0,0,0
"I agree with you, but I think people are pretty bad, too.",0,1,0,0,0
You lost me.,0,1,0,0,0
People are always gossiping about one another.,0,0,0,0,0

"No, I'm fine. Thank you.",1,1,0,0,1
have you finished going through the contract?,0,1,0,0,1
"yes, but I have a few questions for you.",1,1,1,0,1
Ok. Ask away.,1,1,1,1,1
"first, I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave.",1,1,1,0,1
"yes, employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year. However, in order to get paid, you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s.",1,1,0,0,1
even if I ’ m only sick for one day?,0,1,0,0,0
that ’ s correct.,1,1,1,0,1
"that ’ s pretty strict, if you ask me.",0,1,0,0,0
"well, we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month, even though they weren ’ t sick.",0,1,0,0,1
I see. I guess that makes sense.,1,1,1,0,1
do you have any other questions?,1,1,1,0,1
"yes. Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract, but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave. Do you offer anything to fathers?",0,1,1,0,0
we do actually. We can add that as an amendment to your contract.,1,1,1,0,1
how many days of paternity leave do you offer?,1,1,1,0,1
men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child.,1,1,1,0,1
why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave?,0,0,0,0,0
"well, women are the ones giving birth. I think it ’ s fair to give them more time, don ’ t you?",1,1,1,0,1
I guess so. I don ’ t have any other questions. Should I sign here then?,1,1,0,0,1
"yes, please.",1,1,1,0,1
Would you like to order now?,1,1,1,1,1
This all looks good! I think we know what we want.,1,1,1,1,1
"Please let me point out the chef's special, which is blackened catfish.",1,1,1,0,1
"I am dieting, so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce?",1,1,1,0,1
We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs.,1,1,1,1,1
Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian?,1,1,1,0,1
The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice.,1,1,1,1,1
I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce. I would like the garlic sauce on the side.,1,1,1,0,1
"Would you like your salad brought to you with your entree, or would you like it served now?",1,1,1,1,1

One hundred and fifty dollars? What about this other one over here?,0,1,1,0,0
That ’ s one hundred and forty.,1,1,0,0,1
Hmm... that ’ s a bit out of my price range. Can you give me a better deal?,0,1,0,0,0

I don ’ t know... It ’ s still a bit pricey... Thanks anyway.,0,1,0,0,0
my final price! One hundred dollars for both! That ’ s two for the price of one. That ’ s my last offer!,0,0,0,0,1

It should take us back up to Altadena.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, don't you know for sure?",0,0,0,0,0
I'm not really sure if it does or not.,0,1,1,0,0
Are you sure we got on the right bus?,0,1,0,0,0
"I've never taken this bus, but I think it's the right one.",1,1,1,0,0
This place doesn't look like Altadena.,0,1,1,0,0
"That's true, and we have been on this bus for a while.",1,1,1,0,1
Read one of the street signs or something.,0,1,1,0,0
Yikes! Temple City.,0,1,0,0,0

"No problem. Actually, we have some great packages. The most exciting season of Hawaii is now. How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii?",1,1,1,1,1
Sounds good. Are there any group tours I can go with?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes. There will be one at the end of this month. For many people, a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails. For others, it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds. Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation, Hawaii gives you the best of both.",1,1,1,1,1
Great. So how long is the trip?,1,1,1,0,1
15 days. The transportation by air will take five days.,1,1,1,0,1
"Fine. I happen to have 20 days for holiday, so exciting! How many places will be visited and what are they? Where will be staying and how about the food there?",1,1,1,1,1
"Sir, let's do it step by step. First, we will visit over 25 different places. Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island. We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, cool. What's the price for this trip?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package, including everything such as airline ticket, tour guides, hotels and food. All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well. 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money. I will have to think about it.",0,1,0,0,0
"Sure. By the way, this special price is only good through the end of the week.",1,1,1,0,1
Is it Thursday? I mean if I let the chance slide...,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, sir. It will be a great pity!",0,1,0,0,0
"Well. Ok, I will take it.",1,1,1,0,1
Thank you!,1,1,1,0,1
Why do you want to take the police to court?,0,0,0,0,0
They arrested me without probable cause.,0,0,0,0,0
They did?,0,1,0,0,0
They had no reason for arresting me.,0,0,0,0,0
I thought they let you go.,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, the next morning.",1,1,0,0,1
They made you spend the night at the station?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, they did.",1,1,0,0,1
What was their reason for arresting you?,0,1,0,0,0
I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for.,0,0,0,0,0
I see.,0,1,0,0,0
I want justice.,0,0,0,0,1
Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend.,1,1,1,0,1

My advice would be to finish it at once.,0,0,0,0,1
"Hi, excuse me, Sir? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe. My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape. They don ’ t provide any support anymore.",1,1,1,0,0
"Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps, or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical, we ’ Ve got Mary Janes, ballerinas.",1,1,1,1,1
"Show me some classic high heels, please.",1,1,1,0,1
"Ok, right this way. What color did you have in mind?",1,1,1,1,1
Black. Classic.,0,1,0,0,1
"Of course. We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular. Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year. They look great on everyone.",1,1,1,1,1
Umm. too shiny. And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe.,0,1,0,0,0
"OK, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable.",1,1,1,0,1
"I don ’ t like the pointed toes. Let me take a look at what else you have. Too high. That one looks like the back would cut into my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly. I don ’ t want bows. I find slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally, this is what I ’ m looking for.",0,1,0,0,0
What size?,1,1,1,0,1
Seven-and-a-half.,0,1,0,0,0
Here we are. How does it fit?,1,1,1,1,1
"Hmmm.Not good. They ’ re too tight.The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes. And there ’ d be no room for my insoles. You know what? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today. They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to. I ’ ll come back another time.",0,1,0,0,0
"Have a nice day, Ma ’ am.",1,1,1,0,1
What can I do for you?,1,1,1,1,1
I'd like to have my hair cut.,1,1,1,0,1
"OK. This way, please.",1,1,0,0,1
You look so busy.,1,1,1,0,1
We've particularly busy on Sunday. Please sit here. How do you wish it cut?,1,1,1,1,1
Short on both sides. Not so much in the middle.,0,1,1,0,0
"It's a long time since you had a haircut last time, isn't it?",1,1,1,0,1
Yes. You are right.,1,1,1,0,1
How long ago?,1,1,1,0,1
About two months.,1,1,1,0,1
Shall we share a taxi?,1,1,1,1,1
Where are you heading now?,1,1,1,0,1
I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road. It is very close to your house.,1,1,1,1,1
Is that the university next to the Teachers' College?,1,1,1,0,1
That's the one.,1,1,1,0,1
You mean we'll share the taxi?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah. If we share the cab, it'll be cheaper. Besides that your Chinese is better than mine. The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well. Don't worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you.",1,1,1,1,1
Hello. May I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, please. I've been here for nearly two months, but I still haven ’ t found a job. Do you think you can find one for me?",0,1,1,0,0
"Don ’ t worry, we ’ ll try to help you. Will you please fill out this form?",1,1,1,0,1
What ’ s this form for?,0,1,0,0,0
"This is for registration. After you have given us your personal details, we'll match these against new jobs as they come in. And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you.",1,1,1,0,1
That's great. But how long do I have to wait?,1,1,0,0,0
"Maybe several weeks, maybe several months. It's hard to tell.",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, dear. How can I wait for such a long time?",0,1,0,0,0
"Actually, many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there.",1,1,1,0,1
"Then, what do you think I should do?",1,1,1,0,0
"My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself. Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily. If you have friends or relatives here, ask them for help, too.",1,1,1,0,1
I see. Thank you very much for your advice. Bye.,1,1,1,0,1
Keep in touch.,1,1,1,1,1
How are you doing today?,1,1,1,1,1
I'm doing great. What about you?,1,1,1,1,1
"I'm absolutely lovely, thank you.",1,1,1,1,1
Everything's been good with you?,1,1,1,1,1
I haven't been better. How about yourself?,1,1,1,1,1
I started school recently.,1,1,1,0,1
Where are you going to school?,1,1,1,1,1
I'm going to PCC.,1,1,1,0,1
How do you like it so far?,1,1,1,1,1
I like it so far. My classes are pretty good right now.,1,1,1,1,1
I wish you luck.,1,1,1,0,1
Thanks a lot.,1,1,1,0,1
"All right then, Ms. Montgomery. I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon.",1,1,1,0,1
Great. That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision.,1,1,1,0,1
That ’ s what I was thinking. I ’ ll have them there by Thursday.,1,1,1,0,1
Good news. Thanks for getting things done so quickly.,1,1,1,1,1
"Great. My favorite-soup, soup, soup...",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour, sweets.",1,1,1,1,1
Blow my nose?,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, you do that when your nose needs blowing. I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster.",0,1,1,0,1
"No, please, Mom! Don't make me gargle with saltwater!",0,0,0,0,0
"It works better than any medicine, Lily. I'll make you a glass right now, and you'll finish it!",1,1,1,1,1
What a nice garden! Look at these tulips!,1,1,1,1,1
"That would be a good shot. Can you take my picture here, dear? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well.",1,1,1,1,1
"All right. Would you please stand closer to the flower bed? Good. Smile. Say "" cheese "". OK, got you. That's terrific.",1,1,1,1,1
Thanks. Could you take one more from this angle?,1,1,1,0,1
No problem.,1,1,1,0,1
Now let's have one together.,1,1,1,1,1
Do you know how to set up the timer?,1,1,1,0,1
"Let me see... set the timer first and push the button, oh, come here.",1,1,1,1,1
"OK, let's have a try.",1,1,1,1,1
Cheese...,1,1,1,0,1
Did it come out?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, but it's blurred and a little dark.",0,1,0,0,0
Never mind. Let's go to the falls and try again.,1,1,1,1,1
"Ok, let's go.",1,1,1,1,1
Now we have settled the terms of payment. Is it possible to effect shipment during September?,1,1,1,0,1
I don't think we can.,0,1,0,0,0
Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment?,1,1,1,0,1
"By the middle of October, I think.",1,1,1,0,1
"That's too late. You see, November is the season for this commodity in our market, and our Customs formalities are rather complicated.",0,1,0,0,1
I understand.,1,1,1,0,1
"Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks. Thus, after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers. The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season.",0,1,0,0,1
"But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter. In fact, many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter.",1,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Brown, you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us. If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices, we shall lose out.",0,0,0,0,1
"I see your point. However, we have done more business this year than any of the previous years. I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery.",0,1,0,0,1
"That's too bad, but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration.",1,1,1,0,1
You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you. But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands.,1,1,0,0,1
"But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery? Make a special effort, please. A timely delivery means a lot to us.",1,0,0,0,0
All right. We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say.,1,1,1,0,1
"Good morning, sir. How may I help you?",1,1,1,1,1
I'd like to open an account.,1,1,1,0,1
"Certainly, sir. Would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account?",1,1,1,1,1
"Actually, I'd like to open one of each, if that's possible.",1,1,1,1,1
"No problem, sir. What sort of time deposit account would you like to open?",1,1,1,1,1
What are my choices?,1,1,1,0,1
"The minimum time period is three months. The longer the period, the higher the interest rate. If you withdraw your money before time is up, there are penalties.",1,1,0,0,1
Is there anything I can do for you?,1,1,1,1,1
Yes. I am looking for a pair of gloves.,1,1,1,0,1
What about this one? It's the latest.,1,1,1,1,1
"Excuse me, but I want a pair of mittens.",1,1,1,0,1
"I am sorry, it's out of stock right now.",0,1,0,0,0
Fancy seeing you here 。 Lily.,1,1,1,1,1
Yeah.What a surprise!,0,1,0,0,0
How's everything going?,1,1,1,1,1
Fine.thanks.,1,1,0,0,1
"Johnny, I want to thank you.",1,1,1,0,1
"What do you mean, Mom? For breaking your best china?",0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, Johnny, that stuff was dollar store junk. No, I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy.",0,1,0,0,1
"Well, it's more like she kept me busy...",0,1,0,0,0
"I know, and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house. So, thank you.",0,1,0,0,0
Am I back in your good books?,1,1,1,0,0
"Not only that, but I'm going to buy you that video game after all!",1,1,1,1,1
"Where do you usually do your shopping, Mrs. Lane?",1,1,1,1,1
"I usually go to the supermarket, near the station.",1,1,0,0,1
How do you find the prices there?,1,1,1,0,1
"I think they are quite reasonable, and the vegetables are very fresh.",1,1,1,0,1
I see you have bought some coffee.Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it?,1,1,1,0,1
Only 2 dollars and 25 cents.,0,1,0,0,1
"Hey honey, how was your day?",1,1,1,1,1
It was alright. I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam.,1,1,1,1,1
Why? What happened?,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance. This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s.",0,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, you ’ re right. We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older.",0,1,0,0,0
"Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too.",1,1,1,0,1
"Sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.",0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.",1,1,1,0,1
I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.,0,1,1,0,0
Not in a million years!,0,0,0,0,0
Is everything all right?,1,1,1,0,1
Not at all.,0,1,0,0,0
What's the problem?,0,0,0,0,0
Someone just robbed me.,0,0,0,0,0
What do you mean?,0,1,0,0,0
This guy just robbed me right on the street.,0,0,0,0,0
"He didn't hurt you, did he?",0,1,0,0,0
I'm okay. He just stole my things.,0,0,0,0,0
I'm so sorry.,0,1,0,0,0
I have to file a report at the police station.,0,1,0,0,1
Let me take you.,1,1,1,1,1
I would like that.,1,1,1,0,1
"Repair service, how may I help you?",1,1,1,0,1
My phone has got lot of static.,0,1,0,0,0
How old is your phone?,1,1,1,0,1
About five years old.,1,1,1,0,1
The wire in your phone might have gotten rusty. Could you bring your phone into our office? We'll clean it for you.,1,1,1,0,1
"Sure, where is your office?",1,1,1,1,1
We're located at 132 West Street.,1,1,0,0,1
When are you available?,1,1,1,0,1
From 9A. M. to 5 P. M.,1,1,0,0,1
"Alright, I'll bring it in this afternoon.",1,1,0,0,1
No problem. See you this afternoon.,1,1,1,0,1
Good morning. Do I need an appointment?,1,1,0,0,1
"No, ma'am, there's only one person ahead of you. You won't have to wait long.",1,1,1,0,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
"All right, madam, it's your turn. What will it be today?",1,1,1,1,1
"I've been wearing my hair long for years, but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style. What do you suggest for a woman like me, that is, with hair like mine?",1,1,1,0,1
"Come here, please. We'd like to wash your hair first. That way it will be easier to cut and style. I think you'll like this style. It's very fashionable.",1,1,1,1,1
I hope so. I'm really tired of this old-fashioned style that I've been wearing.,0,1,1,0,0
Would you like me to blow-dry your hair?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, if you think it will help.",1,1,1,0,1
What do you think of it?,1,1,1,0,1
It's great! Will it be hard to care for?,1,1,1,1,1
"Not at all. When you wash it, it will fall into place naturally. You'll probably need another cut in about a month. Shall I make an appointment for you?",1,1,1,1,1
By all means.,1,1,1,0,1
Anything I can do for you?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I just forgot where the bed linens department is.",1,1,1,0,0
It's on the third floor.,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
You're welcome.,1,1,1,0,1
"Wow, what a cool car! The styling of this car really appeals to me.",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, this is a very popular car.",1,1,1,0,1
I want to buy it. How much does this car cost?,1,1,1,1,1
"The car is beautiful, isn't it? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price.",1,1,1,1,1
You can tell me here. I just want to know the price.,1,1,1,0,1
"50000 yuan' What a deal! That will, of course, include tax, licence, and registration fee.",1,1,1,1,1
"I appreciate your help, but I think I'll look around a bit.",1,1,1,0,1
Then what price would be fair to you?,1,1,1,1,1
I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car.,1,1,1,0,1
I can see that you are a smart buyer. Forty thousand is my best price.,1,1,1,1,1
Can't you make it cheaper? I still can't afford the car.,0,0,0,0,0
38000yuan is my final offer.,0,1,0,0,1
Hum... OK. I will take it.,1,1,0,0,1
"O. K. So, where do you think we can save more money?",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, we could eat in more. That $ 300 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants.",0,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, that ’ s a good idea, and you like to cook. What about the books?",1,1,1,1,1

"Hey Joe, what are you doing in this department store?",1,1,1,1,1
"Hi, Rita, I ’ m just looking for a pair of shoes. I won ’ t be here for long.",1,1,1,0,1
"Why not? When I go shoe shopping, I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices.",1,1,1,1,1
That ’ s my problem. I don ’ t have a lot of options.,0,1,0,0,0
"So how do you usually go about buying shoes, then?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, first of all, I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, you ’ re in the right store. If they don ’ t have it, no one will.",1,1,1,1,1
"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me. I prefer white, so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.",1,1,0,0,1

Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered?,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching' Titanic.'",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, the file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment, please.",0,1,0,0,0
Thank you for taking care of it so quickly.,1,1,1,0,1
"Sir, when I deleted the $ 10, the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge.",0,1,0,0,0
You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!",0,0,0,0,0

Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue.,0,1,1,0,0
It is true. I think we should change some policies.,1,1,1,0,1
Right. Like our LPF program. The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts.,1,1,1,0,1
"Indeed, it's unfair. Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans. Lower-income households, on the other hand, can only get smaller loans, or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing.",0,1,1,0,0
Like you and me!,1,1,1,1,1
I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation. I hope we can do business together.,1,1,1,1,1
"It's a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. White. I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom. What is it that particularly interests you?",1,1,1,1,1
I am interested in your hardware. I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues. I think some of the items will find a ready market in France. Here is a list of requirements.,1,1,1,1,1
Thank you for your inquiry. Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer?,1,1,1,1,1
"I will do that. Meanwhile, could you give me an indication of the price.",1,1,1,0,1
Here are our FOB price lists. All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation.,1,1,0,0,1
"What about the commission? From European suppliers, I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports. It's the general practice.",1,1,1,0,1
"As a rule we don't allow any commission. But if the order is sizable one, we will consider it.",0,1,0,0,1
You see I do business on a commission basis. A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales. Even 2 or 3 % would help.,1,1,1,0,1
We'll discuss this when you place your order with us.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, sir. May I help you?",1,1,1,0,1
Please I'd like a ticket to New York.,1,1,1,0,1
For today?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, early saturday morning.",0,1,0,0,1
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM. Is that ok?,1,1,1,0,1
Nothing earlier? I prefer flight at 9 thirty.,0,1,0,0,1
"I'm afraid not, unless you want a night flight.",0,1,0,0,0
"No, exactly not.",0,0,0,0,0
How about afternoon?,1,1,1,0,1
Sounds not good. I won't take it.,0,0,0,0,0
"Is there I can do for you, miss?",1,1,1,0,1
Do you know what the weather will be tomorrow? We are planning to climb the mountain.,1,1,1,1,1
"Let me see, oh it's a sunny day. You will have a nice trip tomorrow.",1,1,1,1,1
I hope so. Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
What time is our connecting flight?,1,1,1,0,1
"Let me check. Oh, oh! It ’ s at 3:25.",1,1,1,0,1
"Wow, that's cutting it close! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection! What gate is it at?",1,1,1,1,0
It's at... gate 14.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, great! That's at the other end of the terminal!",0,1,1,0,0
"OK, so here's the plan ; When we land, run to gate 14!",1,1,1,1,1
I'm be right behind ya!,1,1,1,1,1
"You taught at a local school for a year, right?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I was there as an English teacher.",1,1,1,0,1
Did you enjoy yourself there?,1,1,1,1,1
Sure. I was fond of those lovely children,1,1,1,1,1
So why did you decide to resign?,0,1,1,0,0
The school is a little bit too far away. I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather.,1,1,1,0,1
I see. But why don't you continue to work as a teacher?,1,1,1,0,1
I think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life.,1,1,1,1,1
So you can have more room for development.,1,1,1,0,1
And I can experience another kind of life style.,1,1,1,1,1
It sounds like a good idea.,1,1,1,0,1
I hope I can adapt to the new job as soon as possible.,1,1,1,0,0

"In that case, we will have to improve one month further on the time. Now is Jan. If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March, only 2 months are left. The time is too limited.",0,1,0,0,0
You understand a timely delivery is very important to us.,1,1,0,0,1

Woo hoo! This just might be the start of the rest of my life!,1,1,1,1,1
What happened?,0,1,1,0,0
I ’ m in the market for a job! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for. I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write.

But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard.,0,1,1,0,0
We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product. This means that no mistakes are made.,1,1,1,0,1
Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis. Can you tell me a little about that?,1,1,1,1,1

"Yes, but not too stiff, right?",1,1,1,0,1
"Exactly. Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned, too?",1,1,1,0,1
There are a few spots on it. I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow. Dry-cleaning usually takes three days.,0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no. I also need this tomorrow evening.",0,1,0,0,0
"In that case, I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment, and have it well pressed. You might get it back on time then.",1,1,1,0,1
That's a good idea.,1,1,1,0,1
"By the way, a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday.",1,1,1,0,1

We are sorry for our fault.,0,1,0,0,0
I do hope this undesirable incident will not stand in the way of our future business.,0,1,0,0,1

Where did this come from?,0,1,1,0,0
I have no idea.,0,1,0,0,0

"absolutely, I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read.",1,1,1,1,1
good. How about your cover letter?,1,1,1,0,1

As I said in my email, we can help you with production according to your needs, but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis.",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, yes. I reviewed your estimate. But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind. Did you get a copy of the specs for this project?",0,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I have several copies, but they're all different versions... The latest I have is version 12, is that current?",1,1,1,0,1
"No. Later we decided to opt for the prior outline, version 7.",0,1,1,0,1
"Hold on, let me pull up your version 7 requirements... Oh yes, no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind. I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12. That will definitely add to your cost on this project...",1,1,1,0,1
Home at last. Tonight we have a lot of homework though.,0,1,0,0,0
"Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight? Jane, you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much. He gives far too much homework. He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time.",0,0,0,0,0
"To tell the truth, I don ’ t really like him either. He ’ s kind of boring and not very active. He always looks unhappy too.",0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, and he also...",1,1,1,0,1
Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back?,0,1,0,0,0
Probably not. After all he is our teacher. We should try to find something nice to say. If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all.,1,1,1,0,1
I absolutely agree. It ’ s getting dark. We should finish our homework now.,1,1,1,0,1

A ham salad sandwich.,1,1,0,0,1

don't you think it ’ s a bit bright?,0,1,1,0,0
"yeah, maybe you ’ re right. How about this outfit?",1,1,1,1,1
"that dress looks lovely on you, but it ’ s not very practical, is it?",1,1,0,0,0
"no, I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just had to try it on! What do you think about this? It ’ s casual, yet sophisticated.",1,1,1,1,1
"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It ’ s too plain on its own.",0,1,1,0,1
"how about this scarf, these earrings, and an anklet?",1,1,1,1,1
that might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet?,0,1,1,0,1
that ’ s a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.,1,1,1,1,1
"thanks. You ’ d be ok on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",1,1,1,1,1
yep. Here it is. What do you think?,1,1,1,1,1
that looks great. Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them?,1,1,1,1,1
the leopard print sounds fabulous. Are they a name brand?,1,1,1,1,1
"no, they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing.",0,1,1,0,0
that ’ s even better than the real thing.,1,1,1,0,1
"if I were you, I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale. If you spend more than $ 100, you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes.",1,1,1,1,1

OK. I just saw a Versace for thirty dollars. This stuff can't be real!,0,1,1,1,0
Most of it is. You should sign up.,1,1,1,1,1

Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai? They are very safe.,1,1,1,0,1

"Yes, I have read the Filling Instruction carefully, since you showed me it last week.",1,1,1,0,1
"Very good. What is the essence of filing, do you know?",1,1,1,0,1
The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject. And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet.,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes,' One customer--one file' is essential. And remember to update them timely.",1,1,1,0,1

Correct.,1,1,1,0,1

Okay. That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents.,1,1,0,0,1
What's the price? I hope you'll quote us favorably.,1,1,1,0,1
It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg.,1,1,0,0,1
"Frankly speaking, the price you offer is too high. We can't accept it.",0,0,0,0,1
Why? This is a fair market price.,1,1,1,0,1
It certainly is.,1,1,1,0,1
Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price? Please tell me candidly.,0,1,1,0,1
"I look at it this way, suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price, even lower than their home price.",1,1,1,0,1
We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market.,1,1,1,0,1
"That's the point. Your overhead is in your domestic price, but it can't be carried in the CIF price.",0,1,1,0,1
"But even with the overhead out, the export overhead must be put in. Finally, it comes to the same thing. Anyway, this is a quality item and should be sold on its value.",1,1,1,0,1
"I wish you could make a reconsideration. If you don't reduce your price, we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here.",0,0,0,0,0

Incredible. I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket.,1,1,1,1,1
"Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store, although he or she provides' But It Now' prices.",1,1,1,0,1
What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping?,0,1,1,0,0
"Some provide wrong pictures for the goods, so many buyers are deceived.",0,1,0,0,0
That's two for me and one for you.,1,1,1,0,1
That's not fair!,0,0,0,0,0
"Good evening, Pizza House. This is Marty speaking. May I take your order?",1,1,1,1,1

Got it.,1,1,1,0,1
No we are gonna make the batter. Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.,1,1,1,0,1
Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer?,1,1,1,0,1
"Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed. I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.",1,1,1,0,1
"OK, so now we need a baking pan right?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.",1,1,1,0,1
Done. So how long do we bake it for?,1,1,1,0,1
We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes. Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.,1,1,1,0,1
Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!,1,1,1,1,1
"OK, sir. Your suit will be available in five days.",1,1,0,0,1

Thanks.,1,1,1,0,1
How much did you pay for the TV?,1,1,0,0,1

How do you get along with your boss?,1,1,1,0,1
"I had a terrific working relationship with my boss, even though we are very different people. Because I've had a number of bosses, I've come to realize that to make things work, you have to understand what's important to your boss. Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ). It's natural to think about your own agenda first, but if you help your boss, Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time.

There are six on this table.,1,1,0,0,1

Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.,1,1,1,1,1
So hard to choose. I think I'll take this one.,1,1,1,0,0
That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.,1,1,1,1,1

"No, I had it when I left school this afternoon.",0,1,0,0,1
Well. Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school? You might have left it there.,1,1,1,0,1

Perhaps I should call her later.,1,1,1,0,0
I had a look yesterday. I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design. The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles. I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter. I have got some idea of your exports. I am interested in your silk blouses.,1,1,1,1,1
Our silks are known for their quality. They are one of our traditional exports. Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed. They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand.,1,1,1,0,1

Thank you!,1,1,1,0,1
Sorry. The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired.,0,1,0,0,0
Knock on wood. But I have a very important date.,1,1,1,1,1
My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation. Do you have any suggestion about where to go?,1,1,1,1,1
The choice of destination is very important. It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains. But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun.,1,1,1,0,1
Sometimes what young people like is different from the old. Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping.,1,1,1,1,1
That's a good idea. That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves.,1,1,1,1,1
"What should we bring besides a change of clothes, money and some snacks?",1,1,1,1,1
"It's some medicine the doctor recommends. If you leave it at home, you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure.",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, yes! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me. How many days should we spend on a vacation?",1,1,1,1,1
You'd better have all a light schedule. You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired 。,1,1,1,0,1
It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, that's right. Having an enjoyable time together is the goal.",1,1,1,1,1
Owl! I've twisted my ankle. I slipped on that greasy patch over there. I don't think it's broken but it really hurts.,0,1,1,0,0

"Dad, you've been driving for three hours. Why don't we have a switch?",0,1,1,1,1
There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway. Driving on it is experience-demanding.,0,1,0,0,0
Trust me. I've been driving for two years.,1,1,1,0,1
Ok. You drive and do be careful.,1,1,0,0,1
I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai?,1,1,1,0,1
Sorry. No. You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle.,0,1,0,0,1
Too bad. I hate transferring during a flight. It is too complex.,0,1,0,0,0
You have to do it. But it takes only about 30 minutes.,0,1,0,0,1
Really? It used to cost a few hours.,0,1,0,0,0

Great. Thanks so much for your time.,1,1,1,0,1
"We ’ ll contact you soon, Ted. Thanks for coming in.",1,1,1,0,1
What is your greatest strength?,1,1,1,0,1
"I feel my greatest asset is perseverance, that is, the ability to stick to things to get them done.",1,1,1,0,1
Why do you say that?,0,1,1,0,0
I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turned out just as I'd planned.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you do a lot of your shopping online?,1,1,1,0,1
"Not really. I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available, but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it. Sometimes, I ’ ll look at something in a shop, but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper. You don ’ t like buying things online, do you?",1,1,0,0,1
No. I ’ m a little worried about security. You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords. Aren ’ t you worry about that?,0,1,0,0,0
"Not really. I know that it happens, but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites, you should be ok. Even though I use online shopping facilities, I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop.",0,1,0,0,1
I ’ m surprised to hear you say that. I thought you loved anything technological.,1,1,1,0,1
"I do. I ’ m a big fan of using new technology, but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day. I think people need to get out and interact with other people.",1,1,1,1,1
"So, how about coming to the department store with me? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet.",1,1,1,1,1
Sure. I ’ d love to join you. Can we stop by the computer store? I just want to see if they have something.,1,1,1,1,1
Sure. While you ’ re in the computer store. I will visit the book store opposite. I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting.,1,1,1,1,1
Ok. I ’ Ve finished online. Let ’ s go. I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card.,1,1,1,1,1
Thanks for reminding me. I had forgotten to get mine.,1,1,1,0,1
"When we get paid for this assignment, you get US $ 2, TOO, and I get US $ 3,000.",0,1,0,0,1
"Hey, that's not fair. I did as much work as you.",0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, okay, we'll split it 50/50.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hey, Michael. Remember me? I'm Becky. We used to work at Lemans together.",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, sure. How are you? Long time no see. How are things at Lemans?",1,1,1,1,1
It's about the same. I've been thinking of making a change myself. Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, not at all. Go ahead.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I was wondering what the salaries are like? I mean... are they much lower than the corporate world?",1,1,1,0,0
"Well, I can't speak for all universities, but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans. I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation.",0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, that's what I thought. But, I've heard that the perks are better. I was wondering if that was really true.",1,1,1,0,1
I'd have to say yes and no on that. I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to. I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, that's great. It sounds like you're really happy with your move.",1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, I guess I am. Working at a university is really suits me.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hi, my name is Tom.",1,1,1,1,1

Yeah... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there.,1,1,1,0,1
It looks like you guys work hard.,1,1,1,1,1
"I tell you what just between you and me, we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding. Oh, your cubicle is over the. And this way. Those are all private offices--the managers' offices.",1,1,1,1,1
Hmm... Tell me more details about our jobs.,1,1,1,0,1
Sure thing.,1,1,1,0,1
Shall we go to the library by subway?,1,1,1,0,1

But you know I've been working very hard. And I have a family to support.,0,1,0,0,1
"I feel sorry, but that's the decision of the directorate.",0,1,0,0,0
Could you check my list to see whether I have forgotten anything?,1,1,1,0,1
No problem. But how?,1,1,1,0,0
I will open the suitcase and you read through the list.,1,1,1,1,1
Ok. I am done. You have nothing on the list left behind. But I suggest you take sneakers with you.,1,1,1,0,1
Why?,0,1,1,0,0
"It is necessary for you to walk on the street. Otherwise, it will be not good to wear high heeled shoes.",0,1,0,0,1
That makes sense. I will do it.,1,1,1,0,1
You do need to take some medicines with you. Just in case.,1,1,1,0,1

how long is it altogether?,1,1,1,0,1
it ’ s about six or seven miles. That ’ s about the kilometers.,1,1,1,0,1
"that sounds OK. So, we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall.",1,1,1,1,1

"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It ’ s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It ’ s even worse. ”",0,0,0,0,0
"Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite.",0,0,0,0,0
"I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way?",1,1,1,1,1
"The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right?",1,1,1,0,1
"Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits.",1,1,1,0,1
"It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background. Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say, “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners. ” Is there such an expression in Chinese?",1,1,1,1,1
Yes. We say “ eat well and drink well. ”,1,1,1,0,1

"Yes, I've watched the finale for the' Super Girl'. The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US, which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences.",1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind. Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society.",1,1,1,1,1
That' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes.,0,1,1,0,0
But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days. There's no such program on this year.,0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, these programs are gradually losing their appeal.",0,1,0,0,0
No surprise. The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences' appetite.,0,0,0,0,0
And they lack originality. Talent shows like' Super Girl' and' Super Boy' are largely clones of' The American Idol'.,0,0,0,0,0
The same is true for' My Hero'. Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series' The Frog Prince'.,1,1,1,0,1
I think producers are underestimating the audience. They should think of better ways to entertain the general public.,0,1,1,0,1

"We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers. As you know, the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial.

"You certainly drive a hard bargain, Mrs. Brown.",0,0,0,0,1
"On the contrary, Mr. London, we value your friendship more than anything else. We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price.

I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty.",1,1,1,1,1

"Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck.",1,1,1,0,1
"You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?",0,1,1,0,0
"OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.",1,1,0,0,1
"Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.",1,1,1,0,1
"All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.",0,1,0,0,0
"That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level?",1,1,1,0,1
That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.,1,1,1,0,1
"I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.",1,1,1,0,1
"No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation.",1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!",1,1,1,0,1
Hello. How can we be of service?,1,1,1,1,1

"I'm sorry, but June 30 is quite soon. I can't guarantee 1 500 cases, I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases.",0,1,0,0,0
I can agree to that.,1,1,1,0,1
"Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases, to be delivered in 27 days, by June 30, and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15. Right?",1,1,0,0,1
Right.,0,1,0,0,0

"Bill, I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price, for my business is fairly new. I hope that you can make me an advance on loan.",0,1,1,0,0
Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security?,0,1,0,0,1
No. I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation. You may inspect my accounts. From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations.,0,0,0,0,1
We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.,0,1,0,0,1
"Yes, I can. You know Mr. Macready, the famous car dealer here in New York. He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0, 000 until the end of this year.",1,1,1,0,1
Good. He is a man of high standing. I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion. But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan.,1,1,1,0,1

I see. Batwoman married the boss?,1,1,1,0,1

"Now listen, Ben. Look, I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on.

What characteristics should an interpreter own?,1,1,1,0,1
I think he should be an expert of everything.,0,1,0,0,0
Why is that?,0,1,1,0,0
"Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences, probe into physics, release some information in a press conferrence, and do anything we can do with language.

I've never met Darren.But you're right. That would probably be uncomfortable.,0,1,0,0,0

"Mr. Li, does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes. In fact, the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation. The university and the business have a long-term relationship. If you are recommended by your university, you can be approved more easily.",1,1,1,0,1
But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same.,0,1,1,0,0
More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort.,0,1,1,0,0

Perhaps I should call her later.,1,1,1,0,0

What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company?,1,1,1,1,1
I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future. I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing.,1,1,1,1,1
Good. Do you know anything about this company?,1,1,1,0,1

What kind of sponsoring are we talking about? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is...,0,1,0,0,0
It's not what you're thinking. These events will give us a wider exposure than most. Take the tri-city marathon for starters. This is a highly publicized event. The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness.,1,1,1,1,1

My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?,0,0,0,0,0

"Sis, why did you ask me to come to this bargain market? It's so crowded, and you can't find anything that you really want.",0,1,0,0,0
You just don't get it. Looking for bargains can be really interesting.,1,0,1,0,0
Are you serious? How can that be?,0,0,0,0,0
"Bargaining is a game, or even a battle. You feel like a winner when you get a good price.",1,0,1,0,1

It really hurts.,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. You know what I mean?",0,0,0,0,0
To hell with you. The accident was your fault.,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm afraid it wasn't. And when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. But enough of this bickering. I'm going to go find a phone.Don' t move that arm while I'm gone. Alright?",0,0,0,0,1

"We want to make this a trial order. If we can sell all the products in two months, we will pay for them ; if not, we will send them back to you.",1,1,1,0,1

How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work?,1,1,1,0,1
"If I were a manager, I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons. It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction.",1,1,1,0,1
"Exactly, I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning, they were from the company on the 12th floor, I guess. They were only three of us in the elevator, I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry. Anyway, it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others, especially strangers.",0,0,0,0,0
"Sure, no matter what happened, they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way.",1,1,1,0,1

How's your son these days?,1,1,1,0,1

He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you think it is a good age to have a child?,1,1,1,0,1

"Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, but not just yet.",1,1,0,0,1
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country?,1,1,1,0,1

Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.,1,1,1,0,1

I can't believe we did that poorly... If I remember correctly, sales went down slightly, but not as dramatically as the graph shows.",0,1,1,0,0
"I think you are looking at the wrong line. The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products. You are correct, the hair product sales decreased slightly, but not dramatically. The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products. I think there was a problem in the marketing plan. Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products, but it was already too late to mitigate the damage, so our mistake shows up in the sales.",0,1,1,0,1
"Well, the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off. Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks.",1,1,1,1,1
"That is our one major success. If you look at the other graphs, you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase.",1,1,0,0,1

"We should say we are very interested in that job, and we hope to get that job.",1,1,1,1,1
We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job.,1,1,1,1,1
"For example, I have mastered Business English very well, and I also know a little Spanish.",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, you have recommended yourself very well. I should think about how to recommend myself as well.",1,1,1,0,1

Let's write it at once.,1,1,1,0,1
"I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That' s what you think, yes?",1,1,1,0,1
Yes. You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient. I recommend seven.,1,1,1,0,1
"And if we take the Decker units you suggested, what would the price be?",1,1,1,0,1
Let me calculate the price for you. I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let' s see here. Your total would be 5929 dollars.,1,1,1,0,1
Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building?,0,1,1,0,0
"As I said, it is possible, but it would be much more expensive. I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system.",0,1,0,0,1
"That's too much. We need to use the separate units, I guess.",0,1,1,0,0
"It's more practical, and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them.",1,1,1,0,1
So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent, of course.",1,1,1,0,1
You mean installation isn't included? I'm very surprised.,0,1,0,0,0
"No, Ma'am. Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units.",0,1,0,0,1
"In Taipei, you know, the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra.",1,1,1,0,1
"I know that, Ma'am. But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L. A., installation is charged separately.",0,1,0,0,1
"Yes, I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet.",0,1,0,0,0
"I understand, Ma'am.",1,1,1,0,1
And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars.,1,1,1,0,1
"It's a question of quality, Ma'am. At that price, you would not get good equipment. I've been in this business for almost twenty years. I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now, you will just have to replace the system after two years.",0,0,0,0,1
"I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars, installation included, I can accept.",1,1,1,0,1
Well.,0,1,0,0,0
You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you. But I won't pay more than 6000.,1,0,0,0,1
"Well, we don't usually do it, but... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free. Because we appreciate your business.",1,1,1,1,1
Good. I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible.,1,1,1,0,1

So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20.,1,1,0,0,1

Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid the judges do not think so. All the beauty contests are for slim girls only.,0,1,0,0,0
Well. There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties.,0,1,1,0,0

Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes. As you know, that's the common practice for exporting computer. This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation.",1,1,1,0,1
I see. Why not use wooden cases?,1,1,1,0,1
"If you prefer wooden cases, we will provide them. But cardboard boxes are light, less expensive, and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking.",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, I know. Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases?",0,1,1,0,0
"Perhaps. That will be more complicated, if we use wooden boxes.",0,1,0,0,0
Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers.,1,1,1,0,1
"That is guaranteed. Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air, water or stress. Besides, cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping.",1,1,0,0,1

"They are popular in and out of our department. Fred is easygoing, while David is cautious in working.",1,1,0,1,1
All these say a lot for their characters.,1,1,1,0,1
"So, I want to recommend them for a raise. Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office.",1,1,1,1,1

Hello!,1,1,1,1,1

"What happened yesterday? You forgot our date, didn ’ t you?",0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it rained hard all day and I had a bad cold, so I decided to stay home.",0,1,0,0,0
You did? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered.,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, the telephone lines were damaged by the storm. They repaired them yesterday.",1,1,1,0,1

"Alright, tell me what you think.",1,1,1,1,1
Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yeah, maybe you ’ re right. How about this outfit?",1,1,1,1,1
"This dress looks lovely on you, but it ’ s not very practical, is it?",1,1,0,0,1
"No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just had to try it on! What do you think about this? It ’ s casual, yet sophisticated.",1,1,1,1,1
"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It ’ s too plain on its own.",0,1,1,0,1
"How about this scarf, these earrings, AMD an anklet?",1,1,1,1,1
That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet?,0,1,1,0,1
That ’ s a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.,1,1,1,1,1
"Thanks. You ’ d be ok on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",1,1,1,1,1
Yep. Here it is. What do you think?,1,1,1,1,1
That looks great. Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them?,1,1,1,1,1
The leopard print sounds fabulous. Are they a name brand?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing.",0,1,1,0,1
That ’ s even better than the real thing.,1,1,1,0,1
"If I were you, I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale. If you spend $ 100, you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes.",1,1,1,1,1
It ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday!,0,1,0,0,0
I found it at a garage sale once.,1,1,1,0,1
"What a find! So, how much does it cost?",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, because I like you... ninety bucks.",1,1,1,1,1
Ninety dollars is pretty steep. I'll take it for sixty bucks.,0,0,0,0,0
"Sixty bucks? No-can-do, son. You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five.",0,0,0,0,0
Eighty-five? That's the best you can do? I'll come back later...,0,0,0,0,0
How was your test?,1,1,1,0,1
It was bad.,0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, honey, you should study harder.",0,1,0,0,0
But I already tried my best.,0,1,0,0,0
Don't worry. You'll do better next time.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, there is something wrong with my car.",0,1,0,0,0
Your car is rather old. Why not change a new one?,0,1,1,0,1
"I want to change a new car. I like Honda best, especially the red one. But it is too expensive.",1,1,1,0,0
"Oh, there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon. I have two tickets. Would you like to go there with me?",1,1,1,1,1
Yeah. Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda.,1,1,1,1,1
And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years!,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, Mr. Cui, could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company?",1,1,1,0,1

Have you applied for work with any other companies?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I applied with another company, but that was just to get experience in being interviewed.",1,1,1,0,1

"Yes. In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University, and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University.",1,1,1,0,1
How about your academic records at college?,1,1,1,0,1
"In fact my records were excellent. My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale, which was the highest in my class.",1,1,1,0,1
That's very impressive. Which course did you like best?,1,1,1,1,1
"English. It was both interesting and useful, so I showed a great interest in it.",1,1,1,1,1
Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student?,1,1,1,0,1
Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it. I also performed well in the subjects. Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position.,1,1,1,0,1
Did you get any honors and awards at college?,1,1,1,0,1

Can you do something about it?,0,0,0,0,0
I'll see if I can adjust it.,1,1,1,0,1
"That's better, but it's still not quite right.",0,1,1,0,0

Yes. I buy most of my daily necessities online.,1,1,1,0,1
I've never tried E-shopping. Is it better than shopping at an actual store?,1,1,1,0,0
"Yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home.",1,1,1,0,1
"Wounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier.",1,1,1,0,1
And you can still go' window shopping' just like in a real shopping mall.,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, are there any other advantages?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.",1,1,1,0,1
Are there many choices of online shopping?,1,1,1,0,1
Sure. You can buy almost anything you can think of.,1,1,1,1,1

"Actually, I haven ’ t had time to look it over. Did you bring another copy with you?",0,1,0,0,0
"Of course, here you are, sir.",1,1,1,1,1
Call me Mr. Smith.,0,1,0,0,1
"Certainly, Mr. Smith.",1,1,1,0,1
"Pardon me, but I was wondering if you could break a one.",1,1,1,0,1
Let me look. What do you need?,1,1,1,0,1
I need the change for the stamp machine.,0,1,0,0,1
I think dimes and quarters will do.,1,1,0,0,1
I'm sorry to trouble you but there is a lot of noise in next room.,0,1,1,0,0

"If the nest room is still noisy, could you give me a different room please?",0,1,0,0,0
How good is your Mandarin?,1,1,1,0,1
Mandarin is the language I spoke since I was a child. So I can speak it very fluently.,1,1,1,0,1
What dialect do you understand?,1,1,1,0,1
I can speak and read Cantonese because I worked in Guangdong for many years.,1,1,1,1,1
"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months, what are your general impression of it?",1,1,1,1,1
"I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life.",0,1,1,0,0
"You mean, kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined? To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art.",1,1,1,0,1
"An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.",1,1,1,1,1
Thanks for your compliment! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics. Do you know Jin Yong?,1,1,1,1,1
I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels.,1,1,1,0,1
"All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life.",1,1,1,1,1
I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable. It also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life.",1,1,1,0,1
"So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation, isn't it?",1,1,1,0,1
"Indeed, you're exactly right!",1,1,1,1,1
Could you just run through the evacuation procedure?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, of course. When you hear the fire alarm, which is a very loud, continuous ringing noise, you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible.",1,1,1,0,1
Should we use the stairs?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, don't use the lifts. We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure. And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading.",1,1,0,0,1
Have you washed any clothes yet?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, I've only washed my whites.",0,1,0,0,0
"When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in?",1,1,1,0,1
Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes?,1,1,1,1,1
Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle.,1,1,1,0,1
How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash?,1,1,1,0,1
"There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash?",0,1,0,0,0
It's really only a small load.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you mind washing my clothes?,1,1,1,0,1
Not at all. It's no problem.,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you so much.,1,1,1,0,1
It's no trouble at all.,1,1,1,0,1
"Excuse me, I'd like to try some Chinese food.",1,1,1,1,1
We serve excellent Chinese food. Which style do you prefer?,1,1,1,1,1
I know nothing about Chinese food. Could you give me some suggestions?,1,1,1,0,0
"It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food, Shandong food, Sichuan food etc.",1,1,1,0,1
Is there any difference?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy.",1,1,1,0,1
How about Sichuan food?,1,1,1,1,1
Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot. They taste differently.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, really. I like hot food. So what is your recommendation for me?",1,1,1,1,1
I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious. We have a Sichuan food dining room. May I suggest you to go there? It's on the third floor.,1,1,1,1,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
It's my pleasure.,1,1,1,1,1
"Good morning, madam. I think I'm lost here. The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton.",1,1,1,1,0
Do you know in which area?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, I am sorry I have no idea. I am a stranger here.",0,1,0,0,0
"I see. Well, do you know anything near the hotel?",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, yes. My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station.",1,1,1,0,1
Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station.,1,1,1,0,1
Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map?,1,1,1,1,1
OK.,0,1,0,0,0
Excuse me. Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is?,1,1,1,1,1

Thanks a lot.,1,1,1,0,1
You ’ re welcome.,1,1,1,0,1
Excuse me.Does this train go to Brooklyn?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, it does.",1,1,1,0,1
Do you know when it leaves?,1,1,1,0,1
I think it leaves at two thirty.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, it's ten o'clock. I'd better go now.",1,1,0,0,1
Would you stay for another cup of coffee?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, thanks. I'll have to meet my friend at the airport.",0,1,0,0,1

Yes.,1,1,1,0,1
How is this going?,1,1,1,0,1
I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet.,0,1,1,0,0
I can recommend an apartment for you. A friend of mine is about to move. She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer.,1,1,1,1,1
Where is the house?,0,1,0,0,0

Really! So it is just near my office building. Great! How much is the rent?,1,1,1,1,1

Certainly! But I have to contact my friend first.,1,1,1,0,1
All right! Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
"This is a very spacious apartment. It's forty pings, including the parking space. That's about one thousand four hundred square feet.",1,1,1,0,1
Wow. It's just the two of us. I don't know if we need that much room.,0,1,0,0,0

I guess you're right. And we'd like to have company anyway.,1,1,1,1,1
"Exactly, which is why a three-bedroom is better. And look, there are two bathrooms.",1,1,1,1,1
Now that's a plus!,1,1,1,1,1

"And if people drop them, they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers.",1,1,1,1,1
They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes.,1,1,1,1,1
I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce.,1,1,1,1,1
"I have the sauce, but remind me to get some catchup at the shop.",1,1,1,0,1
How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue?,1,1,1,0,1

I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today. Can you all take a look at your schedules?,1,1,1,1,1
Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here. Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a. m.?,1,1,1,0,1

Yes. I have some many clothes stuffed into it. Perhaps I should get rid of some of them. There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore.,0,1,1,0,0
I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe. They take up too much space. There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to. They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition.,1,1,1,0,1
"That ’ s a good idea. After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear, I can see what new clothes I need to buy.",1,1,1,1,1

"Let ’ s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color.

"Now that our bread is ready, let ’ s talk about the ingredients!

I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.",1,1,1,1,1
"Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.",1,1,1,1,1
"Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!",1,1,1,1,1

That's a good idea. Why have I never thought of that?,1,1,1,0,1

I swear I will never shop at a street market in China. It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something.,0,0,0,0,0
"cool down, Harry! What are you really mad about? Did you get ripped off?",0,0,1,0,0
"yes. Last Sunday I went to a nearby market. It was on open-air fair. I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just",1,1,1,1,1
is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets,0,0,0,0,0
but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?,0,0,0,0,0

Could you do something to advance your time of shipment?,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment. I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time.",0,1,0,0,0
I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production.,1,1,1,0,1

"Well, in that case, there is nothing more to be said. What's your last word as to the date then?",0,1,0,0,0
I said by the middle of October. This is the best we can promise.,0,1,0,0,1
All right. I'll take you at your word. May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier? Our letter of credit will be opened early September.,1,1,1,0,1
"Good. Let's call it a deal. We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September. The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled. But of course you cannot count on that. In any case, we'll let you know by email.",1,1,1,0,1

Follow me. All the things you need as a woman are in aisles 10 and 11. This section is usually near the medicine section in any supermarket.,1,1,1,1,1
I'll keep that in mind.,1,1,1,0,1
"Hello baseball fans, and welcome back to today ’ s game! My name is Rick Fields and of course, I am here, once again, with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.'",1,1,1,1,1
It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.,1,0,1,1,1
"Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game. It ’ s time to play ball!",1,1,1,1,1
Roger Vargas is up at bat. The pitcher winds up and strike one!,1,1,1,1,1
"A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign, he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive!",1,1,1,1,1
The players are scrambling to get the ball. Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going! The outfielder throws it to second! Vargas slides! He ’ s safe!,1,1,1,1,1
Great play!,1,1,1,1,1
"We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi! There ’ s the pitch, he hits it! It ’ s going, going, that ball is gone!",1,1,1,1,1
Home run by Okapi! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium!,1,1,1,1,1
Do you want to buy something here?,1,1,1,1,1
These shoes are great! What is the price of this?,1,1,1,1,1
This one is two hundred yuan.,1,1,0,0,1
That's too much!,0,0,0,0,0
"Alan, I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list. Are you interested in some of our products?",1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts, but I find your price is on the high side.",0,1,0,0,0
I'm very surprised to hear you say that. I think our price is very favorable. You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers.,1,1,1,0,1
I'm not so sure of that. I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price.,0,1,0,0,0
What's your proposal then?,1,1,1,0,1
"I think to get the business done, you should at least reduce the price by 20 %.",0,0,0,0,1
"We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one, but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do. What quantity are you going to order from us then?",1,1,1,0,1
"As a trial order, I'll take 5,000 dozen this time.",1,1,1,0,1
"5,000 dozen is by no means a large order. In that case, the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction.",1,1,1,0,1
That's really a big change from 20 %. I really can't accept that.,0,0,0,0,0
What's your counter-offer then?,0,0,1,0,1
"To conclude the deal, I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help.",1,1,1,0,1
15 % is impossible. That'll leave us almost no profit.,0,0,0,0,0
"If that's the case, I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs.",0,1,1,0,0
"How about doing it this way? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction.",1,1,1,1,1
8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial.,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, to encourage future business, I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 %. We can't go any further.",1,1,0,0,1
Ok. Let's call it a deal.,1,1,1,1,1
Roger? I need figures for accounting. Have finished the calculations?,0,1,0,0,1
"I ’ m just finishing now, ma ’ am. I ’ ll have them ready within the hour.",1,1,0,0,1
"All right, thanks.",1,1,0,0,1
"You ’ re welcome, ma ’ am. I ’ ll call you when they ’ re ready.",1,1,1,0,1
How ’ s it going?,1,1,1,1,1
I ’ m great. Thanks.,1,1,1,0,1
What do you need?,0,1,0,0,1
I need to know if I have any fees to pay.,0,1,0,0,0
"Actually, you do owe some fees.",0,0,0,0,1
How much do I owe?,1,1,0,0,1
Your fees total $ 235.13.,0,1,0,0,1
That ’ s crazy!,0,0,1,0,0
You need to pay these fees soon.,0,0,0,0,0
Can I do that right now?,1,1,1,0,0
Will you be paying with cash or check?,1,1,0,0,1
I think I ’ ll be paying with cash.,1,1,0,0,1
Thanks for your help.,1,1,1,0,1
No problem.,1,1,1,0,1
There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask.,0,1,0,0,0
You know that I have no secrets toward you.,1,1,1,0,1
"When you go dinner with John, who foots the bill?",1,1,1,0,1
Why asking that? It's often the sort of Dutch treat.,0,0,0,0,0
Is Betty Sue in her office?,1,1,1,0,1
I ’ m sorry. She ’ s in a meeting right now.,0,1,0,0,1
I see.,0,1,0,0,0
Can I give her a message for you?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, please tell her I stopped by.",1,1,0,0,1
"And your name, please?",1,1,1,0,1
"Ted. Oh, and could you give her this document for me?",1,1,1,0,1
Certainly.,1,1,1,0,1
Good evening.,1,1,1,0,1
Good evening. Could you let us have a double room?,1,1,1,1,1
How long will you be staying?,1,1,1,0,1
"A week or ten days. We'd like to have a quiet room, if possible-not too near the street.",1,1,0,0,1
"Let me see. Yes, you can have Room 313. It's at the back.",1,1,1,0,1
What's the price per day'? And are the meals included or extra?,1,1,1,0,1
"20 pounds per day, including breakfast.",1,1,0,0,1
"All right, we'll take it.",1,1,1,0,1
"Very good, sir. Will you register, please?",1,1,1,0,1
OK.,0,1,0,0,0
Thank you. The porter will show you to your room,1,1,1,0,1
"Sally, do you really need to go?",0,1,0,0,0
Yeah.It' s a must for me.,1,1,1,0,1
But don't forget to give me a ring.,1,1,1,1,1
"I won't, mum.",0,0,0,0,0
"Hello, Anna. Come in and sit down.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hello, doctor.",1,1,1,0,1
What's the matter?,0,1,0,0,0
I've got a backache.,0,1,0,0,0
Do you often suffer from backache?,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I don't. I've never had a bad one before.",1,1,1,0,1
When did it start?,1,1,1,0,1
About four days ago.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, go home and rest in bed for two days, then you'll feel better.",1,1,1,0,1
Can you give me some medicine? It's very painful.,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, I'll give you some pills. Take one a time and three times a day, and come back in three days. If you don't feel...",1,1,1,0,1
What do you want to know about me?,1,1,1,0,1
How about your academic records at college?,1,1,1,0,1
The average grade of all my courses is above 85.,1,1,1,0,1
In which subject did you get the highest marks?,1,1,1,0,1

Have you received any scholarships?,1,1,1,0,1

Have you been a class leader?,1,1,1,0,1
I have been a class commissary in charge of studies for two years.,1,1,1,0,1
Did you join in any club activities?,1,1,1,0,1
I was an aerobics team member in college.,1,1,1,1,1
What sport are you good at?,1,1,1,1,1
I am good at sprint and table tennis.,1,1,1,1,1
You are excellent.,1,1,1,1,1
What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business?,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, there are several things. Of course, you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high.",1,1,1,0,1
"So, do you think workers should be paid as little as possible?",0,0,0,0,0
"No. if you do that, the workers won ’ t like their jobs. They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover. Those things will increase you costs.",0,0,0,0,0
How can a business maximise revenues?,1,1,1,0,1
You need to invest in some good advertising. You have to know where your potential customers are and target them. It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people. The market is too small.,0,1,1,0,1
What else do you suggest?,1,1,1,1,1
"Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services. Price yourself near the low end. Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else, because many customers distrust very cheap things. Th",0,1,1,0,1
Excuse me.,1,1,1,0,1
Yes? How can I help you?,1,1,1,0,1
Are these drinks on sale this weekend?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes.,1,1,1,0,1
Can I buy more than one case?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes. The limit is four per family.,1,1,0,0,1
"Okay, I ’ ll take four, please. You saved me a lot.",1,1,1,0,1
I know. This is a really good bargain.,1,1,1,0,1

No problem.,1,1,1,0,1
"Hey, Mark, long time no see.",1,1,1,1,1
Julie! It's good to see you again. How have you been?,1,1,1,1,1
Great. I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand.,1,1,1,1,1
Really? How was it?,1,1,1,0,1
Fantastic! I didn't want to come back.,0,1,0,0,0
I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful.,1,1,1,0,1
"They are. And not only that the people are friendly, but also the food is delicious, not to mention cheap.",1,1,1,1,1
I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok?,1,1,1,1,1
Not much. I've go enough city life in Beijing.,0,1,0,0,1
I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself.,1,1,1,0,1
"Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime?",1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, it sure would.",1,1,1,0,1
I am so excited!,1,1,1,1,1
Excited about what?,0,1,0,0,0
I just voted.,1,1,1,0,1
Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I just had my 18th birthday this year.",1,1,1,0,1
That ’ s lucky.,1,1,1,0,1
Why is that?,0,1,1,0,0
You turned 18 in an election year.,1,1,1,0,1
I didn ’ t think about it like that.,1,1,1,0,1
Really?,0,1,1,0,0
"No, but that makes me even more excited.",1,1,1,1,1
You ’ re a part of history.,1,1,1,0,1
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms.,1,1,1,0,1
I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents.,0,1,0,0,1
"I fully understand your position. An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time. But, on the other hand it would add to the buying costs. We've been, after all, trading partners for 3 years and you know us well. Can't you give us D / A or D / P?",1,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C.,0,1,0,0,1
"But on our part, our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports. And there is the licensing problem.",0,1,0,0,0
"I understand that. Still, I'm not in a position to help you. Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together.",1,1,1,0,1
Can I get some medicine to help me?,0,1,0,0,0
"For your high blood pressure, we have several choices of medications.",1,1,1,0,1
What types of drugs can I try?,0,1,1,0,0
Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention.,1,1,1,0,1
What about side effects from that medication?,0,1,1,0,0
Most people have no side effects. You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication.,1,1,1,0,1
Do I only need to take that one drug?,1,1,1,0,0
"I am going to add a second drug for now, Lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor.",1,1,1,0,1
What can I expect when I take that medication?,1,1,1,0,0
You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough.,1,1,1,0,1
"Look at the catalogue, John. I think I want to get this red blouse",1,1,1,1,1
Don't you have one like this in blue?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yah, but it doesn't have a red one.",0,1,0,0,0
Do you need every color in the rainbow?,1,1,1,0,1
Yes!,1,1,1,1,1
Ze ze ze... Women!,0,0,0,0,0
Are you watching another news report about the war?,0,1,0,0,0
Yes. The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today. Several military target were destroyed by bombing. Many civilians were among the dead and wounded.,0,0,0,0,0
How did this war start?,0,1,1,0,0
Bout side claim a small area of territory. Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other.,0,0,0,0,0
Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent. Neither side wants to compromise.,0,0,0,0,0
"Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter. Several European countries have agreed to send aid, but are afraid that their planes will be shot down.",0,0,0,0,0
What do you think will happen?,1,1,1,0,0
"Both countries are very poor. Soon they will run out of money to finance the war. Then, perhaps, they will negotiate.",0,1,1,0,0
It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first.,0,1,1,0,1
Great. The bed is exactly what I have been looking for!,1,1,1,1,1
You have good taste. It's made of red wood.,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, I like red wood. How much do you charge for it?",1,1,1,1,1
300 dollars.,0,1,0,0,1
That's sheer robbery!,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, it's worth the price.",1,1,1,0,1
It's more than I can afford. Can I make an offer?,0,1,1,0,0
How much are you willing to pay?,0,0,0,0,0
Shall we make it 250 dollars?,1,1,1,0,1
No. That price would hardly cover the cost.,0,1,0,0,0
What about 260 dollars?,1,1,1,0,1
275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer.,0,0,0,0,1
It's a deal.,1,1,1,0,1
Mr. Wilson. We very regret the mistakes in goods. I am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake.,0,1,0,0,0
We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained.,0,0,0,0,0
"The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation. About the second problem, I admit it's our fault, so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample.",1,1,1,0,1
Well. I hope there won't be such things.,0,1,0,0,0
I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery. We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods.,1,1,1,0,1
What are you doing to your house?,1,1,1,0,1
We're redecorating our living room.,1,1,1,0,1
What are you going to do to it?,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we're going to change the curtains, then we're going to paint the walls.",1,1,1,0,1
What colour are you going to paint them?,1,1,1,1,1
Pale yellow.,1,1,1,0,1
What else are you going to do?,1,1,1,0,1
We're going to put in some new furniture.,1,1,1,1,1
Can you give me a hand with my luggage?,1,1,1,1,1
Of course.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, this apartment is really a must-see. Will you come with me to look at it this weekend?",1,1,1,1,1
"Sure. And if you rent it, maybe I can help you find a roommate too.",1,1,1,1,1
Great! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, my friend Steve. I'll introduce you.",1,1,1,1,1
Can you lend me some money?,0,1,1,0,0
I am sorry. I've already gone through my paycheck for the week.,0,1,0,0,0
You ’ Ve gone through all your money so quickly? I thought you were well-off.,0,1,0,0,0
Not me. You know money always burns a hole in my pocket.,0,1,0,0,0
"You'v been work here for nearly a month, how do you feel about the job?",1,1,1,0,1
"Not bad. Thank you for your help. I am always busy with this job, I feel a bit tired.",0,1,0,0,0
"I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you' ll get used to this busy job.",1,1,1,1,1
"I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. and you have strong working ability and professional skill, it seems that you know all, that's really wonderful!",1,1,1,1,1
You know the phrase the survival of the fittest. We have no choices.,0,0,0,0,0
"That's right, I have to work.",0,1,0,0,1
Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station?,1,1,1,0,1
Do you live in Pasadena?,1,1,1,0,1
My house is up in Altadena.,1,1,1,0,1
You could always take the 264.,1,1,1,0,1
It'll really take me to the station?,1,1,1,0,0
It goes all the way there.,1,1,1,0,1
Do you know what street it goes on?,1,1,1,0,1
Catch it on Altadena Drive.,1,1,1,0,1
I would've never known.,0,1,1,0,0
Now you know.,0,1,0,0,1
I appreciate you telling me.,1,1,1,0,1
No problem.,1,1,1,0,1
"Honey, we are all out of wine and cheese. Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things?",1,1,1,0,1
Can ’ t it wait? I ’ m watching the game right now!,0,0,0,0,0
Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things.,1,1,1,1,1
Fine! What do you need?,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, pick up some cured meats to go with the wine. Maybe a pound of polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale. I think I saw a promotion for pastrami. Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives.",1,1,1,1,1
"Whoa wait a minute! Isn ’ t that a bit too much? I mean, how much is all of this going to cost!",0,0,0,0,0
"Never mind that. Get some dips as well. Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki. If they have bean dip get that as well. Last but not least, get some pickles.",1,1,1,1,1
"Is that all, your majesty?",0,1,0,0,0
Very funny! Get a move on! People will be here any minute.,0,0,0,1,0
"Hello, who's that speaking?",1,1,1,0,1
I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom. Do you still have it now?,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, I do.",1,1,1,0,1
Is there any furniture in it?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it's fully furnished.",1,1,1,0,1
What's the rent for a year?,1,1,0,0,1
"15,000 Yuan, including water, but electricity and gas.",0,1,0,0,1
Where is it located?,1,1,1,0,1
It's in International Trade Zone. It's only ten minutes' walk from the nearest subway station.,1,1,1,0,1
"That's great. But can you make the rent cheaper, let's see, 12,000 Yuan?",1,1,1,0,1
The price can be talked over. How about coming around and taking a look at it first?,1,1,1,1,1
OK. I will be free at tomorrow afternoon. I'll take a taxi to get there.,1,1,0,0,1
"All right, see you.",1,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Black, I' d like to take some time off. I' Ve been feeling exhausted these days.",0,1,0,0,0
"That's no problem. Let me see... You still have ten days annual leave left, is that right?",1,1,1,0,1
Yes. I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off.,1,1,1,0,0
That's long leave. How's your project coming along?,1,1,1,1,1
The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week. I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, all right. But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave.",0,1,0,0,1
"Thank you, Mr.Black. There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment. Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence. He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients.",1,1,1,0,1
Great! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed.,1,1,1,1,1

It's $ 42!! That's expensive!,0,1,0,0,0
"Hey, let me get it for you. It's your birthday present.",1,1,1,1,1
We need to figure out how much money we ’ re spending and what we ’ re spending it on.,0,1,1,0,1
Why?,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, I think we could be saving more.",0,1,1,0,0
"Really, well, o. k. Get the receipts out.",0,1,0,0,0

That ’ s $ 1825.,1,1,0,0,1
"We put $ 500 into the savings account, and $ 750 into our stock account.",1,1,0,0,1
"$ 3075. Our paychecks our $ 3300, combined. That means we don ’ t have any receipts for $ 225.",0,1,0,0,0
Right.,0,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me.Have you got any books on genetic engineering? I've looked for them everywhere, but I can't find any.",1,1,1,0,0

What a pity! I should have come earlier.,0,1,0,0,0
Come some time next week if you like. I think we'll have got some by them.,1,1,1,0,1
"Ok, I will.",1,1,1,0,1
This is the schedule for the project. Any comments or questions?,1,1,1,0,1
I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us.,0,1,1,0,0
Don't worry. These dates are only targets.,1,1,1,0,1
Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem?,1,1,1,1,1
"I don ’ t know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here. What do you think it is?",0,1,0,0,0
"Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look. Mmmm, it doesn ’ t look good.",0,1,0,0,0
What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It ’ s brand new!,1,1,1,1,1
"Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.",0,0,0,0,0
Ugh... So how long is this going to take? An hour?,0,0,0,0,0
"I ’ m afraid a bit more than that. We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again. You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.",0,1,0,0,0
What! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping? This is not happening!,0,0,0,0,0

What's the weather like in your country? I suppose it must be warmer than here.,1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, yes. We have rather mild winters. It always has much sunshine in winter. But it was very foggy when I left two days ago. I knew it would be colder here, but I thought there would be a lot of snow.",1,1,1,0,1
"We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing. In fact, we haven't had any so far this winter. The winter is rather long, but the cold is generally not severe. The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade.",1,1,1,0,1
"What is the temperature today, do you know?",1,1,1,0,1
"About freezing point, I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero.",0,1,0,0,0

It is considerate of your wife.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, she is. By the way, what is the best season in Beijing?",1,1,1,1,1
"Fall is the best season in Beijing. It's neither hot nor cold. The sky is clear and blue. There's hardly any wind, only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable. And we have plenty of sunshine too.",1,1,1,0,1
Really? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time.,1,1,1,1,1
"Good, you are welcome.",1,1,1,1,1

"well, it depends.",0,1,1,0,0
do you think this music is warm matched?,1,1,1,0,1
of course yes.,1,1,1,0,1
how about the lyrics?,1,1,1,0,1
very touching.,1,1,1,0,1
it bring me back to some of my childhood memories.,1,1,1,0,1
"yes, it is so. i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time. it is fun and exciting.",1,1,1,1,1
"of course.it is really fantastic too, and it makes me eager to dance.",1,1,1,1,1
it is full of energy.,1,1,1,1,1
this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying.,1,1,1,1,1
it certainly is.,1,1,1,0,1
Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit.,1,1,1,1,1
All right. In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession.,1,1,1,0,1

we have plenty of postcards to choose from here. The same designs can be found on these posters.,1,1,1,0,1
posters are difficult to travel with. I think I'll just buy the postcards. I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice.,1,1,1,0,1
"yes, we do. They're on the wall behind you.",1,1,1,0,1
how much do they cost?,1,1,1,0,1

here you go.,1,1,1,0,1

"Fat chance, I'm too scared of bungee jumping.",0,1,0,0,0
"No, really, I think you'd like it. I adapted to it right off the bat.",1,1,1,1,1
What did that have to do with me? I'm not the self-seeker like you.,0,0,0,0,0
I can teach you how.,1,1,1,1,1

"Don ’ t you worry, I ’ ll take care of everything! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It ’ s so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!",1,1,1,1,1
Um... no.,0,1,0,0,0
"Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!",1,1,1,1,1
Let's have lunch together today.,1,1,1,1,1

How often are stockholders meetings held?,1,1,1,0,1
"Stockholders meetings are held biannually. Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall. In between the meetings, each stockholder receives biannual reports. Financial statements are made once a year.",1,1,0,0,1
What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings? I'm guessing not a large percentage...,0,1,1,0,0
"You're right, it's a low percentage. Also, in order to attend meetings, you have to hold a certain amount of shares. It's quite a large number, so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings.",0,1,1,0,1
"So, how much say do the stockholders really have?",0,1,1,0,0
"Unless they're united, very little...",0,1,0,0,0
May I take your order now?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak.",1,1,0,1,1
Do you want some salad dressing?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, what kind do you have?",1,1,1,0,1
"We have Italian, French, thousand island and blue cheese.",1,1,1,1,1
I think French will be fine.,1,1,1,0,1
Where is it?,0,1,0,0,0
I'm going to the Golden hotel.,1,1,1,0,1
"Get in, please.",1,1,1,1,1
Thank you. I have an appointment with an important client at 10,1,1,0,0,1
"Don't worry, you'll be there plenty of time. That is it. 7.15 $, please.",1,1,0,0,1
"Thank you.here' s 10 $, just give me 1 $ back, please.",1,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging?",1,1,1,0,1
"Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display.",1,1,0,0,1
"Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive.",1,1,1,0,1
Right you are. We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.,1,1,1,1,1
What about the outer packing?,1,1,1,0,1
"We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton.",1,1,0,0,1
Cartons?,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes.",1,1,0,0,1
Could you use wooden cases instead?,1,1,1,0,1
Why use wooden cases?,1,1,1,0,1
I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load.,0,1,0,0,0
"The cartons are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle. They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo. The stevedores will see to that. Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with straps. Silk blouses are not fragile goods. They can stand a lot of jolting.",1,1,1,0,1
"Maybe you are right, but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London. If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them. This would make the blouses spotted or ruined.",0,1,0,0,0
"No need to worry about that. The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof, and as the boxes are made of cardboard, they will be handled with care.",1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I don't want to take any chances. Besides, cartons are easy to cut open, and this increases the risk of pilferage.",0,1,0,0,0
Tampering with cartons is easily detected. I should say that this rather discourages pilferage.,0,1,1,0,1
"Maybe so, but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage, the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing, or packing unsuitable for sea voyage.",0,1,0,0,0
"But cartons are quite seaworthy. They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports. There are never any complaints from our clients, and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W. P. A. and T. P. N. D.",1,1,1,0,1
"If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing, we would be quite willing to accept cartons.",1,1,1,0,1
"I'm sorry, but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers. We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy, but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap.",0,1,0,0,1
I can understand your position. Perhaps I'm asking too much.,1,1,1,0,0
"We'll use wooden cases if you insist, but the charge for packing will be considerably higher, and it also slows delivery.",0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter.",1,1,1,0,1
Please do. I'll be waiting for your reply.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, my god. What happened? Are we dying?",0,0,0,0,0
Don ’ t sweat it. We will land safely.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, thank you. Mr.Parry, for all your information. Just one more question.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, sir?",1,1,0,0,1
Do you play any sports or games?,1,1,1,1,1
I used to play football regularly when I was at university. And I used to do athletics in the summer.,1,1,1,1,1
And what athletics did you play? Can you remember?,1,1,1,1,1
I was a runner-a long-distance runner.,1,1,1,0,1
And now?,0,1,0,0,0
No. I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married.,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, thank you again for coming to see us. But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams.",1,1,1,1,1
"Certainly, sir.",1,1,0,0,1
"Oh, dear! which dress should I choose? I can't make up my mind. Please help me.",0,1,1,0,0
You know I don't know anything about fashion.,0,1,0,0,0
Which dress do you like best?,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, they are both all right.",1,1,1,0,1
Only all right?,0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no. I mean you look very nice in both of them.",1,1,1,0,1
"Mike, that's no help to me at all. I can't wear both of them at the same time. I want a decision.",0,0,0,0,0
"But after all, it is your decision, not mine.",1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, yes. The green dress is very smart. but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat.",1,1,1,0,0
I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, we just got in some mangoes.",1,1,1,0,1
Mangoes. What are they?,1,1,1,0,0
"Well, it's a fruit with a big nut in it.",1,1,1,0,1
Can you eat the nut?,1,1,1,0,1
"No, you peel off the skin and throw out the nut.",0,1,0,0,1
How much are they?,1,1,0,0,1
"Well, the sale price is $ 1 each.",1,1,0,0,1
What does a mango taste like?,1,1,1,0,1
They're like a citrus fruit.,1,1,1,0,1
How do I know if it's ripe?,1,1,1,0,0
You can buy them hard. Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel.,1,1,1,0,1
Where do they come from?,1,1,1,0,1
Most of them in this store are from Mexico.,1,1,1,0,1
Can I help you?,1,1,1,1,1
I'd like a pair of sports shoes.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, we have all kinds of sports shoes.Could you tell me what kind of sport you usually do?",1,1,1,1,1

"OK, then you can buy a pair of jogging shoes.Here are jogging shoes.Which pair do you like best?",1,1,1,1,1
"Er..., that blue pair. I need size 43, please.",1,1,0,0,0

Good morning. Mrs.Smith.,1,1,1,0,1
"Good morning! Can you help me, please? I'm looking for some books for my mother.",1,1,1,1,1
"Well, what kind of books does she like?",1,1,1,1,1
She's very fond of detective stories?,1,1,1,0,1
I see. Has she read any detective stories?,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, yes!",1,1,1,1,1
Do you know if she's read this one?,1,1,1,0,1
"I'm not sure, but she probably won't remember if she has! She's very forgetful!",0,1,0,0,0
Ah! She has a bad memory. How old is she?,0,1,0,0,0
She's eighty-seven.,1,1,0,0,1
I suggest you take this book. It's very exciting.,1,1,1,1,1
Thank you. That's a good idea. she likes exciting books. Can you suggest another one?,1,1,1,1,1
"Good morning golf aficionados! My name is Rick Fields, and you guessed it, I am here with my main man, Bob Copeland.",1,1,1,1,1
"Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies and gentleman, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars!",1,1,1,1,1
"Whoa, that ’ s a lot of cash! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.",1,1,1,1,1
"All right, we are here at the eighth hole. It ’ s a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole!",1,1,1,1,1
"Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to be very nervous.",0,1,0,0,0
Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It ’ s definitely not his day today. On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.,0,1,0,0,0
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.,0,1,0,0,0
"Oh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, run! Somebody call animal control!",0,0,0,1,0
"Excuse me, Mr. White? I just need you to sign these before I leave.",1,1,0,0,1

"Really? I have been told, by another bank, that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China.",0,1,0,0,0

I am really thirsty.,0,1,0,0,0
How about we go and get something to drink?,1,1,1,1,1
Let's do that.,1,1,1,1,1
Do you know what you want to get?,1,1,1,0,1
A soda sounds good.,1,1,1,0,1
Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty.,0,1,0,0,1

Are they window seats or aisle seats?,1,1,1,0,1
"Let me see... yes, one window seat and one aisle.",1,1,1,0,1
Ok. But can I trade my seat with you? I prefer the one near the window. I'm a terrible flyer. I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed.,0,1,0,0,0
That's fine. I'd like to be on the aisle anyway. It's easier to get in and out.,1,1,1,0,1
Thanks. Where shall we put our luggage?,1,1,1,1,1
"I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment, and the others can go under the seat.",1,1,1,0,1
Good idea.,1,1,1,0,1
Don't forget to keep the seat belt on.,1,1,0,0,1
Ok. Hope it's a pleasant trip.,1,1,1,0,1
Yes!,1,1,1,1,1
And no hijackers.,0,0,0,0,0

You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month.,1,1,1,0,1
Really?,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment.",1,1,1,0,1
"So, if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum?",0,1,1,0,0

What the hell. That doesn't make sense. What are you going to do?,0,0,0,0,0
I have to go to court. A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there.,0,1,0,0,0
That sucks. I'd be pissed if that happened to me.,0,0,0,0,0
I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars.,0,1,0,0,0

"Yes, I think so, too. I must introduce myself in truth.",1,1,1,0,1
I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job.,1,1,1,0,1
"So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter, especially those related to the work.",1,1,1,0,1

Thanks. Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract' shipment on September 15 or earlier'?,1,1,1,0,1

I hope you voted for him.,1,1,1,0,1
Of course I did. Didn ’ t you?,1,1,1,0,1
Of course!,1,1,1,1,1
I have total faith in Obama as our President.,1,1,1,0,1
You do?,0,1,1,0,0
Yeah. I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf.,1,1,1,0,1
Our country really could use some work.,0,1,1,0,0
I believe that change has already begun.,1,1,1,0,1
I couldn ’ t agree more.,1,1,1,0,1
I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country.,1,1,1,0,1

"Thanks, good to meet you, too.",1,1,1,1,1
"You had a long flight, you must be tired.",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, and the food was horrible!",0,1,0,0,0
"Oh, sorry to hear that. But, don worry! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat. First, lets get you to the hotel.",1,1,1,1,1
Great! How will we be getting there?,1,1,1,1,1
"My car is in the parking lot, lets go this way. Let me help you with your bags.",1,1,1,1,1
"Hello, Arthur. What seems to be the problem?",1,1,1,1,1
"Hey doc. Well, I think I might need glasses. I ’ m getting headaches, and I really struggle to see things that are far away. But I have always had 20/20 vision.",0,1,0,0,0
"Sounds like you may be far-sighted. OK, then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.",1,1,1,0,1
"Mmm... X, E, R, 3, a question mark, and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign.",1,1,1,0,1
"Wow, Arthur! You ’ re as blind as a bat!",0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I know, my vision is really blurry at times.",0,1,0,0,0
"Ok then, head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.",1,1,1,1,1
Thanks doc!,1,1,1,0,1
"Arthur, that ’ s the bathroom.",1,1,0,0,1
Did you need help with something?,1,1,1,1,1
I don ’ t know where to get my ballot.,0,1,0,0,0
I can help you with that.,1,1,1,1,1
How can you help me?,1,1,1,0,1
I work here.,1,1,0,0,1
That ’ s great.,1,1,1,0,1
May I see your ID?,1,1,0,0,1
Here it is.,1,1,1,0,1
"All right, here is your ballot card.",1,1,1,0,1
What do I do now?,0,1,0,0,0
Go to a voting booth and vote.,1,1,1,0,1
All right. Thanks for your help.,1,1,1,0,1
Are you looking for shoes?,1,1,1,1,1
"Yes, could you give me some ideas?",1,1,1,0,1
What about this brown one?,1,1,1,0,1
"Fine, it's the thing for me. I will take it.",1,1,1,0,1
"Hello, who is speaking, please?",1,1,1,0,1
"Hello, Mr. Stern. This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency. I have made the plane reservations for you.",1,1,1,1,1
"Oh, good. Let me get a pencil and take down the information. Well, go ahead, please.",1,1,1,0,1
"Okay. You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines, flight number 222.",1,1,0,0,1
What time does it leave?,1,1,1,0,1
It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10.,1,1,0,0,1
That is good.,1,1,1,0,1
"You want to fly first class. Is that correct, Mr. Stern?",1,1,1,0,1
That's right.,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats. Your seat numbers are 8A, 8B and 8C.",1,1,1,1,1
"Those are in the non-smoking section, aren't they?",1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, they are. I have charged the tickets to your credit card. They are 630 dollars each, so It is 1890 dollars for all three.",1,1,0,0,1

Thanks.,1,1,1,0,1
It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods.,1,1,1,0,1
And that is?,0,1,0,0,0
How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York?,1,1,1,1,1
"I'm afraid we can't agree to that. We concluded the business with you here in Houston, and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York. We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle. Hong Kong is out of the question.",0,0,0,0,1
"It's like this. There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka, while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent. If shipment were effected from Hong Kong, we could receive the goods much earlier.",1,1,1,0,1
"I see. You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong, where they can be transshipped. Is that the idea?",1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, exactly, because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date.",1,1,1,1,1
"Your idea may be a good one, but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong. How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network? You may choose either one as port of shipment. It makes no difference to us. There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York.",0,1,1,0,1
"It sounds all right to me, but I will have to think about it. I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow. If I choose Seattle, will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March?",1,1,1,0,1
"We'll try our best. Anyway, we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April.",1,1,1,0,1
"I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice, but something ’ s come up.",0,1,0,0,0
You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting?,1,1,1,0,1
"That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it. Mr. Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place. I ’ m leaving today, and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday.",0,1,0,0,1
"That ’ s quite a while. Let ’ s make it the week after you get back, then.",1,1,1,0,1
"That will be great. So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow, same time and place. I ’ m really sorry to do this to you.",1,1,1,0,1
"No problem at all. To tell you the truth, I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork.",1,1,1,0,1
Would you show me some table-cloths?,1,1,1,0,1
Certainly. ( Take a table-cloth to her ),1,1,1,0,1
How much is it?,1,1,0,0,1
A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan.,1,1,0,0,1
That ’ s reasonable.,1,1,1,0,1
"If you take good care of it, it will last you quite a number of years.",1,1,1,0,1
Really? I ’ ll take it then.,1,1,1,1,1
"I'm planning to buy a bicycle. As you are quite a cycling enthusiast, I wish you might give me some advice.",1,1,1,1,1
"With pleasure, chap. But before I start, I need to know what you want a bike for?",1,1,1,1,1
"My purposes are two-fold. On the one hand, I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work. On the other hand, bicycling is a sport, and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends.",1,1,1,0,1
Cycling during weekends? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns?,1,1,1,1,1
Does that make any difference?,0,1,0,0,0
"Can't be greater. If you ride on bumpy, hilly roads, a mountain bike is what you need. But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes, you might choose a road bike.",1,1,1,0,1
Are they designed differently?,1,1,1,0,1
"A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame. Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars. It's not particularly beefy in construction, and generally, it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces. In contrast, mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame. You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over.",1,1,1,0,1
I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you.,1,1,1,1,1
Would mornings or afternoons be best for you?,1,1,1,1,1
It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon.,1,1,1,0,1
It is best if we can go during the week;  does that work for you?,1,1,1,0,1
"Because of work, I can only go look at houses on the weekend.",1,1,0,0,1
"Would you like to meet at the real estate office, or should I pick you up at home?",1,1,1,1,1
"If you could pick me up at home, that would be great.",1,1,1,0,1
We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see.,1,1,1,1,1
"That might be a little too much, but we ’ ll see how it goes.",1,1,1,0,1
I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times.,1,1,1,0,1
"Mrs. Lee, I ’ Ve stayed here for almost a week. And I really must leave tomorrow.",0,1,0,0,1
Please feel free to stay as long as you want. You know you ’ re always welcome here.,1,1,1,1,1
Thank you. You ’ Ve been so nice to me.,1,1,1,0,1
Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave?,1,1,1,1,1
"No, thanks. You ’ Ve done a lot for me already. Thank you for everything.",1,1,1,0,1
Don ’ t mention it. I ’ Ve really enjoyed your company.,1,1,1,1,1
Mr. Black? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company.,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, yes. Step inside, will you? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you. Take a seat. We can go into details later.",1,1,1,1,1
Thank you.,1,1,1,0,1
"Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws, bolts, nuts, pins, studs, and that kind of things.",1,1,1,0,1
For wood or for metal?,1,1,1,0,1

"Yes, quite free until noon.",1,1,1,0,1

"Yeah, sir. Your shirt will be ready by Thursday morning. Anything else?",1,1,1,0,1
I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned. Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow? It's urgent.,1,1,0,0,1
"No problem, sir.",1,1,1,0,1

I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley?,1,1,1,0,1
Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.,0,1,1,1,1
Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?,1,1,1,0,1
"Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that.",0,1,0,0,0
Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too?,1,1,1,0,1
I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day. So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments. I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think.,0,1,1,0,0
It's rainy weather today. Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep.,1,1,1,0,1
"Yes, that's what I plan to do. Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it.",0,1,1,0,0
"That bad, huh?",0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, I'm very nauseous. It's mostly nausea and a fever.",0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I'll cancel your appointments for today. And I'll tell Mr. Morley.",0,1,0,0,1
